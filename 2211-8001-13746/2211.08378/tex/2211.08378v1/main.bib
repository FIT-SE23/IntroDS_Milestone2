abstract={Detecting anomalies in data is a vital task, with numerous high-impact applications in areas such as security, finance, health care, and law enforcement. While numerous techniques have been developed in past years for spotting outliers and anomalies in unstructured collections of multi-dimensional points, with graph data becoming ubiquitous, techniques for structured graph data have been of focus recently. As objects in graphs have long-range correlations, a suite of novel technology has been developed for anomaly detection in graph data. This survey aims to provide a general, comprehensive, and structured overview of the state-of-the-art methods for anomaly detection in data represented as graphs. As a key contribution, we give a general framework for the algorithms categorized under various settings: unsupervised versus (semi-)supervised approaches, for static versus dynamic graphs, for attributed versus plain graphs. We highlight the effectiveness, scalability, generality, and robustness aspects of the methods. What is more, we stress the importance of anomaly attribution and highlight the major techniques that facilitate digging out the root cause, or the `why', of the detected anomalies for further analysis and sense-making. Finally, we present several real-world applications of graph-based anomaly detection in diverse domains, including financial, auction, computer traffic, and social networks. We conclude our survey with a discussion on open theoretical and practical challenges in the field.},

abstract={Social network sites have attracted millions of users with the social revolution in Web 2.0. A social network is composed of communities of individuals or organizations that are connected by common interests. In the social network sites, a user can register other users as friends and enjoy communication. In such a scenario, often users face problems in finding their appropriate friends using typical friend-of-friend-recommendation methods. In this paper, we propose a friend-recommendation system based on cohesion. We analyze the cohesive subgroup on an augmented network formed by the physical connection network with the information of common interests and interactions. All the users in a cohesive subgroup should be friends to each other. We validated our idea on a small friend network.},
