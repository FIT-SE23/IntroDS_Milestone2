ABSTRACT = {As reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been gradually brought to reality, a large amount of research has been conducted to investigate the immense benefits of RISs. That is because RISs enable us to artificially direct the radio wave propagating through the environment at a relatively low cost. This paper investigates the trade-off between spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) in the RIS-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output downlink. We develop an optimization framework for designing the transmitting precoding at the base station and the phase shift values at the RIS to balance the EE-SE trade-off. The proposed iterative optimization framework for the design includes quadratic transform, alternating optimization, and weighted minimization mean-square error conversion. Simulation results illustrate our optimization framework algorithm exhibits effectiveness and a fast convergence rate.},

 abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to delineate an algorithm for fractional programming with nonlinear as well as linear terms in the numerator and denominator. The algorithm presented is based on a theorem by Jagannathan [7] concerning the relationship between fractional and parametric programming. This theorem is restated and proved in a somewhat simpler way. Finally, it is shown how the given algorithm can be related to the method of Isbell and Marlow [6] for linear fractional programming and to the quadratic parametric approach by Ritter [10]. The Appendix contains a numerical example.},
