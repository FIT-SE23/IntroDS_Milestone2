\section{Conclusions and future works}
\label{sec:conclusions}
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work proposing a contrastive learning loss for regression in medical imaging. We employ it to predict chronological 
brain age, using the OpenBHB multi-site MRI challenge.  We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the challenge score and in terms of generalization capabilities to unseen sites. This represents a valuable result for the scientific community, as building a robust brain age prediction model can help in better understanding neurodevelopmental or neurodegenerative disorders. We empirically demonstrate that contrastive learning is also capable of (partially) debiasing the site effects. In future, we will extend our experiments to include debiasing techniques, such as regularization terms \cite{barbano2023unbiased} 
 adapted for regression, to further improve the results.
