  abstract = {Machine learning techniques are commonly used to model complex relationships but implementations on digital hardware are relatively inefficient due to poor matching between conventional computer architectures and the structures of the algorithms they are required to simulate. Neuromorphic devices, and in particular reservoir computing architectures, utilize the inherent properties of physical systems to implement machine learning algorithms and so have the potential to be much more efficient. In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of individual domain walls in magnetic nanowires are suitable for implementing the reservoir computing paradigm in hardware. We modelled the dynamics of a domain wall placed between two anti-notches in a nickel nanowire using both a 1D collective coordinates model and micromagnetic simulations. When driven by an oscillating magnetic field, the domain exhibits non-linear dynamics within the potential well created by the anti-notches that are analogous to those of the Duffing oscillator. We exploit the domain wall dynamics for reservoir computing by modulating the amplitude of the applied magnetic field to inject time-multiplexed input signals into the reservoir, and show how this allows us to perform machine learning tasks including: the classification of (1) sine and square waves; (2) spoken digits; and (3) non-temporal 2D toy data and hand written digits. Our work lays the foundation for the creation of nanoscale neuromorphic devices in which individual magnetic domain walls are used to perform complex data analysis tasks.}

Our results indicate that defects of this nature, which can easily result from the fabrication process, or are sometimes deliberately introduced during the fabrication process, will significantly alter the frequencies, magnetic field dependence of the frequencies, and the power and phase profiles of the resonant spin wave modes. They can also spawn new resonant modes and quench existing ones. All this has important ramifications for multi-device circuits based on spin waves, such as phase locked oscillators for neuromorphic computing, where the device-to-device variability caused by defects can be inhibitory.},

The method is implemented in a finite-difference code running on central processing units (CPUs) as well as graphics processing units (GPUs). This setup enables us to compute accurate hysteresis loops of large systems with a reasonable computational effort. As a benchmark, we solve the {$\mu$}Mag standard problem \#1 with a high spatial resolution and compare the results to the solution of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in terms of accuracy and computing time.},

However, the relaxation time of the samples may require a lower repetition rate of the pump pulse compared to the full repetition rate of the x-ray pulses from the synchrotron. The use of only the x-ray pulse immediately following the pump pulse is not efficient and often requires special operation modes where only a few buckets of the storage ring are filled. We designed a novel software defined photon counting system that allows to implement a variety of pump-probe schemes at the full repetition rate. The high number of photon counters allows to detect the response of the sample at multiple time delays simultaneously, thus improving the efficiency of the experiment. The system has been successfully applied to time resolved scanning transmission x-ray microscopy. However, this technique is applicable more generally. \textcopyright{} 2007 American Institute of Physics.}

  abstract = {The stability and sizes of chiral skyrmions in ultrathin magnetic films are calculated accounting for the isotropic exchange, Dzyaloshinskii\&ndash;Moriya exchange interaction (DMI), and out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy within micromagnetic approach. Bloch skyrmions in ultrathin magnetic films with B20 cubic crystal structure (MnSi, FeGe) and Neel skyrmions in ultrathin films and multilayers Co/X (X = Ir, Pd, Pt) are considered. The generalized DeBonte ansatz is used to describe the inhomogeneous skyrmion magnetization. The single skyrmion metastability/instability area, skyrmion radius, and skyrmion width are found analytically as a function of DMI strength d . It is shown that the single chiral skyrmions are metastable in infinite magnetic films below a critical value of DMI d c , and do not exist at d {$>$} d c . The calculated skyrmion radius increases as d increases and diverges at d \&rarr; d c \&minus; 0 , whereas the skyrmion width increases monotonically as d increases up to d c without any singularities. The calculated skyrmion width is essentially smaller than the one calculated within the generalized domain wall model.}

Exploration of the solutions to these equations has made fitful progress since that time as the point vortex model has been brought to bear on various physical situations: atomic structure, large scale weather patterns, \cyrchar\cyrv\cyrchar\CYRDJE\cyrchar\cyrnje vortex street\cyrchar\cyrv\cyrchar\CYRDJE\cyrchar{\'\cyrk} wakes, vortex lattices in superfluids and superconductors, etc. The point vortex equations also provide an interesting example of transition to chaotic behavior.

They are line excitations of the conical helix phase and possess a universal far field that is characterized by their strength {$\nu$} {$\in$} Z. Their micromagnetic core structure can be multifarious. Focusing on {$\nu$} = {$\pm$}1 we showed that it can be either smooth or singular comprising a chain of Bloch points. The core of screw dislocations with larger strength |{$\nu$}| can be even richer that will be shown elsewhere. Moreover, screw dislocations carry a finite non-integer skyrmion charge Ntop and can thus be efficiently manipulated by spin currents [37].},

  abstract = {When electrons pass through a cylindrical electrical conductor aligned in a magnetic field, their wave-like nature manifests itself as a periodic oscillation in the electrical resistance as a function of the enclosed magnetic flux1. This phenomenon reflects the dependence of the phase of the electron wave on the magnetic field, known as the Aharonov\textendash Bohm effect2, which causes a phase difference, and hence interference, between partial waves encircling the conductor in opposite directions. Such oscillations have been observed in micrometre-sized thin-walled metallic cylinders3,4,5 and lithographically fabricated rings6,7,8. Carbon nanotubes9,10 are composed of individual graphene sheets rolled into seamless hollow cylinders with diameters ranging from 1\,nm to about 20\,nm. They are able to act as conducting molecular wires11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18, making them ideally suited for the investigation of quantum interference at the single-molecule level caused by the Aharonov\textendash Bohm effect. Here we report magnetoresistance measurements on individual multi-walled nanotubes, which display pronounced resistance oscillations as a function of magnetic flux.We find that the oscillations are in good agreement with theoretical predictions for the Aharonov\textendash Bohm effect in a hollow conductor with a diameter equal to that of the outermost shell of the nanotubes. In some nanotubes we also observe shorter-period oscillations, which might result from anisotropic electron currents caused by defects in the nanotube lattice.}

It is an applied discipline that is so forward-looking that much of the research that supports it is at the center of basic condensed matter physics. This review provides a perspective on recent developments in switching magnetic moments by spin-polarized currents, electric fields, and photonic fields. Developments in the field continue to be strongly dependent on the exploration and discovery of novel material systems. An array of novel transport and thermoelectric effects dependent on the interplay between spin and charge currents have been explored theoretically and experimentally in recent years. The review highlights select areas that hold promise for future investigation and attempts to unify and further inform the field.}

  abstract = {We make a constraint hamiltonian analysis of the nonrelativistic CP1 model in 2 + 1 dimensions, enjoying U(1) gauge invariance. The expression of the U(1) gauge field on CP1 obtained geometrically is reproduced by the constraint hamiltonian analysis. To begin with, the CP1 model is defined weakly on S3. A subsequent gauge fixing brings down the model strongly on S2. This helps us to establish a connection between the CP1 model and the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) model using a Jordan map. The intimate connection between the gauge choices in the CP1 model leading to different spin lagrangians and the geometry of the LL model is elucidated. Stereographic projection shows the remarkable result that the different spin lagrangians simplify to a unique expression in terms of stereographic variables. Momentum generators are obtained by using Noether's prescription from the CP1 model and show in a gauge independent manner that these do not commute in the nontrivial sector, agreeing with the results quoted in the literature. The angular momentum can also be defined and found to be conserved. Finally, imparting independent dynamics to the gauge field by introducing a Chern-Simons term, we find that the translational symmetry is restored, but it is no longer a CP1 model.}

Ferromagnetic resonance is the method of choice for a quantitative analysis of relaxation rates, magnetic anisotropy and susceptibility in a single experiment. The approach offers the possibility of coherent control and manipulation of nanoscaled structures by microwave irradiation. Here, we analyze the different excitation modes in a single nanometer-sized ferromagnetic stripe. Measurements are performed using a microresonator set-up which offers a sensitivity to quantitatively analyze the dynamic and static magnetic properties of single nanomagnets with volumes of (100 nm)3. Uniform as well as non-uniform volume modes of the spin wave excitation spectrum are identified and found to be in excellent agreement with the results of micromagnetic simulations which allow the visualization of the spatial distribution of these modes in the nanostructures.},

A splitting of the vortex core gyration mode is observed when the inter-disc separation is 200 nm or less and the splitting is controllable by a bias magnetic field. The observed mode splitting is interpreted by micromagnetic simulations as the normal modes of the vortex cores analogous to the coupled classical oscillators. The splitting depends upon the strength of the inter-disc magnetostatic coupling mediated by magnetic side charges, which depends strongly on the magnetic ground states of the samples.}

If the potential is not everywhere zero, and excluding throughout the exceptional case where it has a zero-energy bound state, heuristic arguments show that RL,R(0)=-1, that theta (0)=1/2 pi (-1/2 pi ) when nb is odd (even), and that tau (0)= pi (nb-1/2); (by convention, tau ( infinity )=0= theta ( infinity )). Thus mod tau (0) mod cannot be less than 1/2 pi , no matter how weak the potential; the transition to the limit of zero potential is non-uniform. In the special case of reflection-symmetric potentials, rho =0, one can subdivide nb=nb(e)+nb(o), and define even- and odd-parity phase shifts E=1/2( tau + theta ) and Delta =1/2( tau - theta ); then E(0)= pi (nb(e)-1/2), Delta (0)= pi nb(o). The appendix shows how E(0) is obtainable by suitably adapting the familiar s-wave argument which exploits the analyticity properties of the Jost solutions.}

We explain the advantages of this geometry for determining the fundamental quantities underlying spin-polarized transport, describe the different techniques developed to measure the CPP-MR, summarize the salient features of the models used to analyze experimental data, and describe tests of those models. We then review what has been learned so far about spin-dependent scattering anisotropy and spin relaxation in F-metals and at F/N interfaces, specific resistances of F/N interfaces, the temperature dependence of spin-polarized transport parameters, and mixing of the spin-polarized electron currents. After a brief overview of some new directions, we conclude with a list of questions still to be answered.},

  abstract = {We study three distinct types of planar, spherically symmetric and localized structures, one of them having non-topological behavior and the two others being of topological nature. The non-topological structures have energy density localized in a compact region in the plane, but are unstable against spherically symmetric fluctuations. The topological structures are stable and behave as vortices and skyrmions at larger distances, but they engender interesting compact behavior as one approaches their inner cores. They are semi-compact skyrmion-like spin textures generated from models that allow to control the internal behavior of such topological structures.}

The answer is that if H has an unbroken \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0034-4885/70/6/R03/rpp189078in001.gif] \textbackslash mathcalP\textbackslash mathcalT symmetry, then it has another symmetry represented by a linear operator \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0034-4885/70/6/R03/rpp189078in004.gif] \textbackslash mathcalC . In terms of \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0034-4885/70/6/R03/rpp189078in004.gif] \textbackslash mathcalC , one can construct a time-independent inner product with a positive-definite norm. Thus, \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0034-4885/70/6/R03/rpp189078in001.gif] \textbackslash mathcalP\textbackslash mathcalT -symmetric Hamiltonians describe a new class of complex quantum theories having positive probabilities and unitary time evolution. The Lee model provides an excellent example of a \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0034-4885/70/6/R03/rpp189078in001.gif] \textbackslash mathcalP\textbackslash mathcalT -symmetric Hamiltonian. The renormalized Lee-model Hamiltonian has a negative-norm 'ghost' state because renormalization causes the Hamiltonian to become non-Hermitian. For the past 50 years there have been many attempts to find a physical interpretation for the ghost, but all such attempts failed. The correct interpretation of the ghost is simply that the non-Hermitian Lee-model Hamiltonian is \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0034-4885/70/6/R03/rpp189078in001.gif] \textbackslash mathcalP\textbackslash mathcalT -symmetric. The \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0034-4885/70/6/R03/rpp189078in004.gif] \textbackslash mathcalC operator for the Lee model is calculated exactly and in closed form and the ghost is shown to be a physical state having a positive norm. The ideas of \#\#IMG\#\# [http://ej.iop.org/images/0034-4885/70/6/R03/rpp189078in001.gif] \textbackslash mathcalP\textbackslash mathcalT symmetry are illustrated by using many quantum-mechanical and quantum-field-theoretic models.}

  abstract = {Magnetic skyrmions are nanometric spin textures of outstanding potential for spintronic applications due to unique features governed by their non-trivial topology. It is well known that skyrmions of definite chirality are stabilized by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchange interaction (DMI) in bulk non-centrosimmetric materials or ultrathin films with strong spin-orbit coupling in the interface. In this work, we report on the detection of magnetic hedgehog-skyrmions at room temperature in confined systems with neither DMI nor perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We show that soft magnetic (permalloy) nanodots are able to host non- chiral hedgehog skyrmions that can be further stabilized by the magnetic field arising from the Magnetic Force Microscopy probe. Analytical calculations and micromagnetic simulations confirmed the existence of metastable N\'eel skyrmions in permalloy nanodots even without external stimuli in a certain size range. Our work implies the existence of a new degree of freedom to create and manipulate skyrmions in soft nanodots. The stabilization of skyrmions in soft magnetic materials opens a possibility to study the skymion magnetization dynamics otherwise limited due to the large damping constant coming from the high spin-orbit coupling in materials with high magnetic anisotropy.},

We first specify how a spin-torque term may be added to the usual Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation of magnetization motion and detail its physical meaning. After a brief description of spin-torque driven dynamics in the macrospin approximation, we discuss the validity of this approximation for various experimentally relevant geometries. Next, we perform a detailed comparison between accurate experimental data obtained from nanopillar devices and corresponding numerical modeling. We show that, on one hand, many qualitatively important features of the observed magnetization dynamics (e.g. non-linear frequency shift and frequency jumps with increasing current) can be satisfactory explained by sophisticated micromagnetic models, but on the other hand, understanding of these experiments is still far from being complete. We proceed with the numerical analysis of point-contact experiments, where an even more complicated magnetization dynamics is observed. Simulations reveal that such a rich behavior is due to the formation of several strongly non-linear oscillation modes. In the last part of the paper we emphasize the importance of sample characterization and conclude with some important remarks concerning the relation between micromagnetic modeling and real experiments.},

  abstract = {The radial equation for scattering from a cylindrically symmetrical potential is examined, because two-dimensional scattering arises in high-energy electron diffraction from crystals. Particular attention is paid to the case of s waves, where there is a centripetal attractive potential for free particles. After showing that the Langer transformation, which leads to correct semiclassical wavefunctions for all other cases in two and three dimensions, fails for s waves, the method of comparison equations is applied, which enables the phase shifts and bound state conditions to be expressed in a simple form valid for all angular momenta. The theory is tested for s waves by comparison with exactly-calculated energy levels.}

Two different types of the substrate are considered, usual normal metal and single-layer graphene. We show that a proper treatment of the long-range RKKY interaction leads to a qualitatively different scenario compared to previous studies, where solitons were stabilized by the frustrated exchange coupling (leading to terms with the fourth power of the magnetization gradients) or by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (described by terms linear in the magnetization gradients). In the case of a metallic substrate, the skyrmion stabilization is possible under restrictive conditions on the Fermi surface parameters, while in the case of a graphene substrate the stabilization is naturally achieved in several geometries with a lattice-matching of graphene and magnetic layer.},

In this paper the analytical expression for the magnetic vector potential, magnetic flux density and magnetic field for a two dimensional Halbach cylinder are derived. The remanent flux density of a Halbach magnet is characterized by the integer p. For a number of applications the force and torque between two concentric Halbach cylinders are important. These quantities are calculated and the force is shown to be zero except for the case where p for the inner magnet is one minus p for the outer magnet. Also the force is shown never to be balancing. The torque is shown to be zero unless the inner magnet p is equal to minus the outer magnet p. Thus there can never be a force and a torque in the same system.},

The explicit expressions for spin waves scattering on the domain wall are obtained. The phase shift of a spin wave, as the result of collision of spin wave with a moving wall, is exactly determined. The change in magnon density of states is calculated from this scattering data, and the contribution of domain walls to the classical low-temperature thermodynamics is found.}

These surface-induced chiral interactions may stabilize modulated and multidimensional localized structures which are generally unstable in bulk magnetic materials. We derive micromagnetic equations to calculate magnetic patterns in the nanostructures with induced chiral interactions. Within this theory solutions for isolated magnetic vortices have been obtained. These intrinsically stable nanoscale magnetic patterns existing even in zero field are much smaller than well-known magnetic bubbles and may be used in magnetic storage technologies.}

For the first time SMR signals have been identified in the 1D paramagnetic phase (T\$\textbackslash sim\$\${$>\$\$\backslash$}sim\$TN1\$\textbackslash sim\$[?]\$\textbackslash sim\$21\$\textbackslash sim\$K). They reveal a strong soliton damping and an appreciable resonant frequency renormalization, both associated with the soliton dynamics. For H[?], the SMR signals provide an evidence for the dyon precession described recently for magnetic chains. These SMR signals have been followed below TN1, confirming the persistence of solitons in the ordered phases of this compound.}

We show using micromagnetic simulations that the direction of the current induced DW motion and the associated DW velocity depend on the relative values of the field like torque (FLT) and the Slonczewski like torques (SLT). The results are well explained by a collective coordinate model which is used to draw a phase diagram of the DW dynamics as a function of the FLT and the SLT. We show that a large increase in the DW velocity can be reached by a proper tuning of both torques.}

This procedure solves the damped Gilbert equation for a continuous magnetic medium, including all interactions in standard micromagnetic theory in three-dimensional regions of arbitrary geometry and physical properties. The magnetization is linearly interpolated in each tetrahedral element in a finite element mesh from its value on the nodes, and the Galerkin method is used to discretize the dynamic equation. We compute the demagnetizing field by solution of Possion's equation and treat the external region by means of an asymptotic boundary condition. The procedure is implemented in the general purpose dynamical micromagnetic code (GDM). GDM uses a backward differential formula to solve the stiff ordinary differential equations system and the generalized minimum residual method with an incomplete Cholesky conjugate gradient preconditioner to solve the linear equations. GDM is fully parallelized using MPI and runs on massively parallel processor supercomputers, clusters of workstations, and single processor computers.},

So far, experimentally observed supercurrent phenomena such as superconductivity and superfluidity have been restricted to cryogenic temperatures. Here, we report on the discovery of a supercurrent in a Bose-Einstein magnon condensate prepared in a room-temperature ferrimagnetic film. The magnon condensate is formed in a parametrically pumped magnon gas and is subject to a thermal gradient created by local laser heating of the film. The appearance of the supercurrent, which is driven by a thermally induced phase shift in the condensate wavefunction, is evidenced by analysis of the temporal evolution of the magnon density measured by means of Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy. Our findings offer opportunities for the investigation of room-temperature macroscopic quantum phenomena and their potential applications at ambient conditions.}

Our analysis shows that for the PSSWs the observed exchange stiffness of iron is about 20\% smaller compared to the established iron bulk value. In addition, we find an interface-related reduction of the effective exchange stiffness for layers with the thickness below 10 nm. To understand and discuss the possible mechanisms of the exchange stiffness reduction we develop an analytical 1D-model. In doing so we find that the interface induced reduction of the exchange stiffness is mode-dependent.},

The PSSWs are excited by optically generated ultrashort spin current pulses, and probed optically in the time domain. Analyzing the wavenumber and thickness dependence of the damping, we demonstrate that at sufficiently large wave vectors \$k\$ the damping is dominated by spin transport effects scaling with k\^4 and limiting the frequency range of observable PSSWs. Although this contribution is known to originate in the spin diffusion, we argue that at moderate and large k a more general description is necessary and develop a model where the 'transverse spin mean free path' is the a key parameter, and estimate it to be \textasciitilde 0.5 nm.},

  abstract = {Cylindrical magnetic nanowires show great potential for 3D applications such as magnetic recording, shift registers, and logic gates, as well as in sensing architectures or biomedicine. Their cylindrical geometry leads to interesting properties of the local domain structure, leading to multifunctional responses to magnetic fields and electric currents, mechanical stresses, or thermal gradients. This review article is summarizing the work carried out in our group on the fabrication and magnetic characterization of cylindrical magnetic nanowires with modulated geometry and anisotropy. The nanowires are prepared by electrochemical methods allowing the fabrication of magnetic nanowires with precise control over geometry, morphology, and composition. Different routes to control the magnetization configuration and its dynamics through the geometry and magnetocrystalline anisotropy are presented. The diameter modulations change the typical single domain state present in cubic nanowires, providing the possibility to confine or pin circular domains or domain walls in each segment. The control and stabilization of domains and domain walls in cylindrical wires have been achieved in multisegmented structures by alternating magnetic segments of different magnetic properties (producing alternative anisotropy) or with non-magnetic layers. The results point out the relevance of the geometry and magnetocrystalline anisotropy to promote the occurrence of stable magnetochiral structures and provide further information for the design of cylindrical nanowires for multiple applications.},

This is a crucial feature when studying the influence of the microstructure on the performance of composite materials, which is demonstrated by hysteresis calculations of soft magnetic structures that are operated in a closed magnetic loop configuration. The applied differential formulation is perfectly suited for the application of true periodic boundary conditions. The finite difference equations can be solved by a highly efficient Fast Fourier Transform method.},

  abstract = {Confinement alters the energy landscape of nanoscale magnets, leading to the appearance of unusual magnetic states, such as vortices, for example. Many basic questions concerning dynamical and interaction effects remain unanswered, and nanomagnets are convenient model systems for studying these fundamental physical phenomena. A single vortex in restricted geometry, also known as a non-localized soliton, possesses a characteristic translational excitation mode that corresponds to spiral-like motion of the vortex core around its equilibrium position. Here, we investigate, by a microwave reflection technique, the dynamics of magnetic soliton pairs confined in lithographically defined, ferromagnetic Permalloy ellipses. Through a comparison with micromagnetic simulations, the observed strong resonances in the subgigahertz frequency range can be assigned to the translational modes of vortex pairs with parallel or antiparallel core polarizations. Vortex polarizations play a negligible role in the static interaction between two vortices, but their effect dominates the dynamics.}

The frequency of the modes with circular nodes increases with the number of nodes. In contrast, the frequency of the modes with diametric nodes decreases with the number of nodes. This behavior is explained accurately by an analytical model.},

  abstract = {A two-parameter analytical model is constructed to describe a thin, magnetically soft, circular disk in the vortex state. The model is capable of describing the change in evolution of net magnetization and of vortex core position when the core interacts with a magnetic pinning site. The basis of the twoparameter model is formed by a piecewise, physically continuous, magnetization distribution constructed with two regions described by different one-parameter models. Benchmarking against numerical simulations of ideal disks with and without pinning sites shows that the model provides accurate predictions of magnetization, hysteretic transitions, and 2-D displacement of the vortex core in the presence of pinning sites. The demonstrated accuracy of the model supports its use as an empirical tool to extract quantitative maps of vortex pinning energies from measurements of magnetization.},

  abstract = {Magnetic skyrmions are topological quasi particles of great interest for data storage applications because of their small size, high stability, and ease of manipulation via electric current. Theoretically, however, skyrmions are poorly understood since existing theories are not applicable to small skyrmion sizes and finite material thicknesses. Here, we present a complete theoretical framework to determine the energy of any skyrmion in any material, assuming only a circular symmetric 360\$\^\textbackslash circ\$ domain wall profile and a homogeneous magnetization profile in the out-of-plane direction. Our model precisely agrees with existing experimental data and micromagnetic simulations. Surprisingly, we can prove that there is no topological protection of skyrmions. We discover and confirm new phases, such as bi-stability, a phenomenon unknown in magnetism so far. The outstanding computational performance and precision of our model allow us to obtain the complete phase diagram of static skyrmions and to tackle the inverse problem of finding materials corresponding to given skyrmion properties, a milestone of skyrmion engineering.},

In this study, we describe a novel experimental approach to observe spin-transfer torques induced by thermal gradients in magnetic multilayers by studying their ferromagnetic resonance response in microwave cavities. Utilizing this approach allows for measuring the magnetization dynamics on micron/nano-sized samples in open-circuit conditions, i.e. without the need of electrical contacts. We performed first experiments on magnetic tunnel junctions patterned into 6 \texttimes{} 9 \textmu m 2 ellipses from Co 2 FeAl/ MgO/CoFeB stacks. We conducted microresonator ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) under focused laser illumination to induce thermal gradients in the layer stack and compared them to measurements in which the sample was globally heated from the backside of the substrate. Moreover, we carried out broadband FMR measurements under global heating conditions on the same extended films the microstructures were later on prepared from. The results clearly demonstrate the effect of thermal spin-torque on the FMR response and thus show that the microresonator approach is well suited to investigate thermal spin-transfer-driven processes for small temperatures gradients, far below the gradients required for magnetic switching.},

The analysis of the reduced equations reveals that Imax is periodic of period and yields the amplitude of its variation with the magnetic field H. In particular it is proportional to when aw and is reduced when the mis-alignment b is increased. Since the geometric parameters can be freely chosen in the fabrication process we suggest that experimentalists can design a device to suit specific needs.}

  abstract = {Energetic ion bombardment of solid targets can lead to the production of atomic recoils and defects within the solid and the ejection or sputtering of atoms from the surface with the consequent erosion of the solid. The yield of sputtered atoms per ion depends on a number of ion and target parameters but, particularly, on the gradient of the surface with respect to the incident ion flux, the surface curvature and higher spatial derivatives of the height. As a result of these dependences of the local erosion rate, the morphology of a surface can be modified. But, in addition, surface atomic relaxation effects which may be mediated by the irradiation can occur and so the evolution of the surface may be complex. If the nature of these, often competing, processes is understood and can be suitably controlled by selection of experimental conditions, ion beam erosion can be employed to generate useful surface geometries. This review briefly summarizes current understanding of the sputtering process and the origin of the above dependences and describes how, if only a surface gradient related mechanism dominates, the evolution of surface geometry can be accurately predicted. The higher-order and surface relaxation processes are then considered in both a deterministic approach and in a stochastic approach and these are shown to lead to fine spatial scale modifications to evolving surfaces. In both these areas, the physical models are supported by experimental observations. It is then shown how the lowest and higher orders and competing mechanisms can be selected in order to produce the desired surface morphologies in several application areas, including depth profiling of impurities in solids, ion milling and polishing, and the creation of repetitive surface structures.}

The solver, based on a mixed plane-wave/interpolating scaling function representation, can deal with any kind of periodicity (along one, two, or three spatial axes) as well as with fully isolated boundary conditions. It can seamlessly accommodate a finite screening length, non-orthorhombic lattices, and charged systems. This approach is particularly advantageous because convergence is attained by simply refining the real space grid, namely without any adjustable parameter. At the same time, the numerical method features O(NlogN) scaling of the computational cost (N being the number of grid points) very much like plane-wave methods. The methodology, validated on model systems, is tailored for leading-edge computer simulations of materials (including ab initio electronic structure computations), but it might as well be beneficial for other research domains. \textcopyright{} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

  journal = {ArXiv e-prints},
  abstract = {Based on micromagnetic simulation and analysis of Thiele's equation, in this work we demonstrate that ratchet motion of skyrmion can be induced by a biharmonic in-plane magnetic field hx(t) = h1sin(mwt) + h2sin(nwt + phi), provided that integers m and n are coprime and that m + n is odd. Remarkably, the speed and direction of the ratchet motion can be readily adjusted by the field amplitude, frequency and phase, with the maximum speed being over 5 m/s and the direction rotatable over 360 degree. The origin of the skyrmion ratchet motion is analyzed by tracing the excitation spectra of the dissipation parameter D and the skyrmion position R, and it shows that the dissipative force plays a key role in the appearance of ratchet motion. Such a ratchet motion of skyrmion is distinguished from those caused by single-frequency ac drives reported in the literature, and from that driven by pulsed magnetic fields as also predicted in this work. Our results show that skyrmion ratchet effect under biharmonic forces shares some common features of those found in many soliton systems, and the facile controllability of both the skyrmion speed and direction should be useful in practice.},

The out-of-plane magnetization in the nanometer-scale vortex core induces a three-dimensional handedness in the planar magnetic structure, leading to a precessional motion of the core parallel to a subnanosecond field pulse. The core velocity was an order of magnitude higher than expected from the static susceptibility. These results demonstrate that handedness, already well known to be important in biological systems, plays an important role in the dynamics of microscopic magnets.}

Particularly, for a countable set of interaction strength values, a non-zero transmission through the point potential \cyrchar\CYRO\cyrchar\cyrgup '( x ), defined as the weak limit (in the standard sense of distributions) of a special dipole-like sequence of rectangles, is shown to exist when the rectangles are squeezed to zero width. A tripole sequence of rectangles, which gives in the weak limit the distribution \cyrchar\CYRO\cyrchar\cyrgup ''( x ), is demonstrated to exhibit the total transmission for a countable sequence of the rectangle's width that tends to zero. However, this tripole sequence does not admit a well-defined point interaction in the zero-range limit, making sense only for a finite range of the regularizing rectangular-like potentials.}

The existence of these objects depends on (among other conditions) the existence of a conserved charge, Q, associated with an ungauged unbroken continuous internal symmetry. These objects are spherically symmetric, and for large Q their energies and volumes grow linearly with Q; thus they act like homogeneous balls of ordinary matter, with Q playing the role of particle number. This paper proves the fundamental existence theorem for these Q-balls, computes their elementary properties, and finds their low-lying excitations.}

Two methods of introducing the rotating potential are considered\textendash adiabatically increasing the rotation frequency at fixed ellipticity, and adiabatically increasing the trap ellipticity at fixed rotation frequency. Extensive simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation are employed to map out the points where the condensate becomes unstable and ultimately forms a vortex lattice. We highlight the key features of having a quantized vortex in the initial condensate. In particular, we find that the presence of the vortex causes the instabilities to shift to lower or higher rotation frequencies, depending on the direction of the vortex relative to the trap rotation.}

In agreement with recent experiments (Zakeri et al 2010 Phys. Rev.

It is also predicted that, for non-zero wave vectors, the resonance frequency and resonance field can increase or decrease depending on the spin-wave vector orientation. We provide explicit formulas for the spin-wave dispersion relation and its asymmetry, as well as for the dynamic susceptibility for a film under microwave excitation, that can be used to understand ferromagnetic resonance as well as Brillouin light scattering experiments in these classes of magnetic thin films.},

Many of these applications require the nanodots to be in the single domain state, to have well-controlled aniosotropy and low hysteresis. In this paper, the physics which controls these aspects of magnetic behaviour on the nanometre scale is described, with particular reference to a phenomenon known as configurational anisotropy. These physical principles are illustrated by two potential applications of magnetic nanodots: high sensitivity magnetic field sensors and high density low power magnetic logic gates.}

  abstract = {Nanometre scale magnetic particles (`nanoelements' or `nanomagnets') form a rich and rapidly growing new area in condensed matter physics, with many potential applications in data storage technology and magnetic field sensing. This paper reviews an extensive study into the influence of shape on the properties of nanomagnets in the size range 35-500 nm. Elliptical, triangular, square, pentagonal and circular geometries have all been considered. It is shown that the size, thickness and geometric shape of nanomagnets all play a vital role in determining the magnetic properties. The shape, size and thickness of a nanomagnet are shown to be linked to its magnetic properties by two distinct phenomena. The first is called configurational anisotropy and describes the role played by small deviations from uniformity in the magnetization field within the nanostructures, which allow unexpected higher-order anisotropy terms to appear. These anisotropies can often dominate the magnetic properties. The second is the competition which exists between exchange energy and magnetostatic energy. This competition determines whether the nanomagnets exhibit single domain or incoherent magnetization and also controls the non-uniformities in magnetization which lead to configurational anisotropy. Understanding the influence of shape opens the way to designing new nanostructured magnetic materials where the magnetic properties can be tailored to a particular application with a very high degree of precision.}

  abstract = {Landau\textendash Lifshitz\textendash Gilbert (LLG) equation is the fundamental equation to describe magnetization vector field dynamics in microscale and nanoscale magnetic systems. This equation is highly nonlinear in nature and, for this reason, it is generally solved by using numerical techniques. In this paper, the mid-point rule time-stepping technique is applied to the numerical time integration of LLG equation and the relevant properties of the numerical scheme are discussed. The mid-point rule is an unconditionally stable and second order accurate scheme which preserves the fundamental geometrical properties of LLG dynamics. First, it exactly preserves the LLG property of conserving the magnetization magnitude at each spatial location. Second, for constant in time applied fields, it preserves the LLG Lyapunov structure, namely the fact that the free energy is a decreasing function of time. In addition, in the case of zero damping, the mid-point rule preserves the conservation of the system free energy. The above preservation properties are unconditionally valid, i.e. they are fulfilled for any value of the time-step. Finally, the LLG hamiltonian structure in the case of zero damping is preserved up to the third order terms with respect to the time-step. The main difficulty related to this scheme is the necessity of solving a large system of globally coupled nonlinear equations. This problem has been circumvented by using special and reasonably fast quasi-Newton iterative technique. The proposed numerical scheme is then tested on the standard micromagnetic problem no. 4. In the numerical computations, the spatial discretization is obtained by finite difference technique and the magnetostatic field is computed through the Fast Fourier Transform method.},

  abstract = {The small oscillation modes in complex micromagnetic systems around an equilibrium are numerically evaluated in the frequency domain by using a novel formulation, which naturally preserves the main physical properties of the problem. The Landau\textendash Lifshitz\textendash Gilbert (LLG) equation, which describes magnetization dynamics, is linearized around a stable equilibrium configuration and the stability of micromagnetic equilibria is discussed. Special attention is paid to take into account the property of conservation of magnetization magnitude in the continuum as well as discrete model. The linear equation is recast in the frequency domain as a generalized eigenvalue problem for suitable self-adjoint operators connected to the micromagnetic effective field. This allows one to determine the normal oscillation modes and natural frequencies circumventing the difficulties arising in time-domain analysis. The generalized eigenvalue problem may be conveniently discretized by finite difference or finite element methods depending on the geometry of the magnetic system. The spectral properties of the eigenvalue problem are derived in the lossless limit. Perturbation analysis is developed in order to compute the changes in the natural frequencies and oscillation modes arising from the dissipative effects. It is shown that the discrete approximation of the eigenvalue problem obtained either by finite difference or finite element methods has a structure which preserves relevant properties of the continuum formulation. Finally, the generalized eigenvalue problem is solved for a rectangular magnetic thin-film by using the finite differences and for a linear chain of magnetic nanospheres by using the finite elements. The natural frequencies and the spatial distribution of the natural modes are numerically computed.},

Porous alumina is used as a template for the growth by electrodeposition of metallic spin valves in series. Under specific magnetic field and injected current conditions, emission of microwave current is detected with frequency in the 1.5 GHz range and linewidth as low as 8 MHz. We find strong indications that the microwave emission is due to spin-transfer-driven vortex oscillations. This technique is promising for the fabrication of dense arrays of STNOs in view of device synchronization.}

Each individual hysteresis loop pinpoints two sharp events, a single vortex creation and an annihilation, with a bias field precision of 0.02 kA m \cyrchar\cyrv\texteuro ' 1 . Statistical analysis of thousands of hysteresis loops reveals a dramatic difference in the sensitivity of the vortex creation and annihilation field distributions to the measurement conditions. The data sets measured at different magnetic field sweep rates demonstrate that the transition from the high-field state to the vortex state is not well modeled as a conventional thermal activation process in which it is assumed that the 'true' nucleation field is lower than any of the observed switching fields. Instead, the results are suggestive of the classic supercooling signature of a first-order phase transition, or more specifically here, its magnetic equivalent. This phenomenological evidence is consistent with a theoretical picture of the vortex nucleation process as a modified Landau first-order phase transition.}

  abstract = {This review is devoted to both the experimental and theoretical aspects of lateral confinement effects observed for spin waves, with the wavevector in the 102-106 cm-1 range, where the magnetic dipole interaction plays the most important role. The Brillouin light scattering (BLS) technique is a powerful tool for the investigation of these effects. In addition to a high sensitivity, which is characteristic for a standard BLS system, we have extended the method to achieve high lateral spatial (30-50 [mu]m), as well as temporal (1-2 ns) resolution. This is central for the studies summarized in the review. Two representative experimental situations are reviewed: (1) Spin wave confinement in micron size laterally pattered structures (regular arrays of magnetic dots and wires). We focus on the quantization of spin wave wavevectors due to the lateral boundaries of a dot or a wire, and the influence of the static and dynamic coupling between islands. (2) Spatial, temporal and spatio- temporal confinement of linear and nonlinear spin waves in magnetic ferrite films. The formation, propagation, and collision of envelope solitons and their two-dimensional analogs (spin wave bullets) are analyzed. Both analytical and numerical models for spin waves in quasi-one-dimensional waveguides and in wide films are discussed.}

In this work an analytical formula for the speed of the domain wall that explains this behavior is derived by means of an asymptotic study of the Landau Lifshitz Gilbert equation for thin nanotubes.},

  abstract = {Micromagnetic simulations are elaborated to describe the magnetic dynamics in ferromagnetic bodies. In these simulations, most of the time is spent on the evaluation of the magnetostatic field in the magnetic material. This paper presents a new numerical finite difference scheme for the evaluation of the magnetostatic field based on the fast multipole method (FMM). The interactions between finite difference cells are described in terms of far and near field interactions. The far field computations are conducted using the spherical harmonic expansion of the magnetostatic field while the near field computations are accelerated using fast Fourier transforms (FFT). The performance of the presented FMM scheme is studied by comparing the scheme with a pure FFT scheme. The FMM scheme is more memory efficient and more flexible then the FFT scheme. It is accurate and still has a good time efficiency.},

  abstract = {Micromagnetic distributions of the vortex and onion type have been widely studied in the context of planar structures. Recently a significant interest to nanomagnets with curved shape has appeared. In particular, spherical shells are currently of great interest due to their capability to support skyrmion solutions which can be stabilized by curvature effects only, in contrast to the planar case where the intrinsic Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction is required. It is well established that the effects of the demagnetizing field operator can be reduced to an effective easy-surface anisotropy for planar thin shells whose thickness is much less than the size of the system. The result has later been extended to surfaces whose closure is diffeomorphic to the closed unit disk of \$\textbackslash mathbbR\^2\$. The aim of the paper is to perform a rigorous {$\Gamma$}-development analysis of the micromagnetic energy functional, when the shell is generated, like in the case of a sphere, by a bounded and convex smooth surface.},

The director patterns about positive and negative disclinations are studied by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Defects are located at the specimen-air interface and occur due to the different boundary conditions of the liquid crystal at the air and glass interfaces. The annihilation behavior of these integer defects, created by a temperature-drop procedure from an initial isotropic state into the nematic state, was also investigated. It was found the relation between pair separation, D, and annihilation time, t 0, was D \cyrchar\CYRO{$\pm$} (t 0 - t)0.5, which was in good agreement with the recent scaling solution prediction by Pargellis et al. 1}

  abstract = {Large-amplitude magnetization dynamics is substantially more complex compared to the low-amplitude linear regime, due to the inevitable emergence of nonlinearities. One of the fundamental nonlinear phenomena is the nonlinear damping enhancement, which imposes strict limitations on the operation and efficiency of magnetic nanodevices. In particular, nonlinear damping prevents excitation of coherent magnetization auto-oscillations driven by the injection of spin current into spatially extended magnetic regions. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate that nonlinear damping can be controlled by the ellipticity of magnetization precession. By balancing different contributions to anisotropy, we minimize the ellipticity and achieve coherent magnetization oscillations driven by spatially extended spin current injection into a microscopic magnetic disk. Our results provide a route for the implementation of efficient active spintronic and magnonic devices driven by spin current.},

  abstract = {We study the energy spectrum of magnons in a ferromagnet with topologically nontrivial magnetization profile. In the case of inhomogeneous magnetization corresponding to a metastable state of ferromagnet, the spin-wave equation of motion acquires a gauge potential leading to a Berry phase for the magnons propagating along a closed contour. The effect of magnetic anisotropy is crucial for the Berry phase: we show that the anisotropy suppresses its magnitude, which makes the Berry phase observable in some cases, similar to the Aharonov-Bohm effect for electrons. For example, it can be observed in the interference of spin waves propagating in mesoscopic rings. We discuss the effect of domain walls on the interference in ferromagnetic rings, and propose some experiments with a certain geometry of magnetization. We also show that the nonvanishing average topological field acts on the magnons like a uniform magnetic field on electrons. It leads to the quantization of the magnon spectrum in the topological field. \textcopyright{} 2005 The American Physical Society.},

  abstract = {Spin-polarized current can excite the magnetization of a ferromagnet through the transfer of spin angular momentum to the local spin system. This pure spin-related transport phenomenon leads to alluring possibilities for the achievement of a nanometer scale, complementary metal oxide semiconductor-compatible, tunable microwave generator that operates at low bias for future wireless communication applications. Microwave emission generated by the persistent motion of magnetic vortices induced by a spin-transfer effect seems to be a unique manner to reach appropriate spectral linewidth. However, in metallic systems, in which such vortex oscillations have been observed, the resulting microwave power is much too small. In this study, we present experimental evidence of spin-transfer-induced vortex precession in MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions, with an emitted power that is at least one order of magnitude stronger and with similar spectral quality. More importantly and in contrast to other spin-transfer excitations, the thorough comparison between experimental results and analytical predictions provides a clear textbook illustration of the mechanism of spin-transfer-induced vortex precession.}

The transverse displacement of the vortices is proportional to the phase shift in the object wave. Tracking the vortices permits the phase of the object to be reconstructed. We demonstrate the method experimentally using a simple lens and a more complex object, namely the wing of a common house fly. Since the technique is implemented in real space, it is capable of reconstructing the phase locally.},

We analytically derive the shape of the Bloch point that is an extremum of the free energy with exchange, dipolar and Landau terms. From a one parameter family of solutions, two types of singularities are distinguished, a radial one (hedgehog) corresponding to a local energy maximum, and a twisted one corresponding to a local energy minimum. Micromagnetic simulations show that the hedgehog magnetization naturally evolves to a twisted one if the size of the ferromagnet is much larger than the exchange length.}

We show that positive (negative) Gaussian curvatures privilege merons with positive (negative) winding number. As in the case of unidimensional domain walls, we found that chirality is connected to the polarity of the core. Both effects allow to predict the topological properties of metastable states knowing the geometry of the surface. These features are related with the recently predicted Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya emergent term of curved surfaces. The presented results are at our knowledge the first ones drawing attention about a direct relation between geometric properties of the surfaces and the topology of the hosted solitons.}

A major challenge to achieve this new skyrmion-based technology is the controlled and systematic creation of magnetic skyrmions without the need of complex setups. We demonstrate a solution to this challenge by showing how to create skyrmions and other magnetic textures in ferromagnetic thin films by means of a homogeneous DC current and without requiring any standard "twisting" interactions like Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya. This is possible by exploiting a dynamical instability arising by the interplay of current-induced spin-transfer torque and locally engineered anisotropies. The magnetic textures are created controllably, efficiently, and periodically with a period that can be tuned by the applied current strength. We propose specific experimental setups realizable with simple materials, such as cobalt or permalloy, to observe the periodic formation of skyrmions. Thus our findings allows for the production of skyrmions on demand in simple ferromagnets by homogeneous DC currents.},

We show that a sparse preconditioner for a nonlinear conjugate gradient energy minimizer can lead to a speed up by a factor of 3 and 7 for computing hysteresis in soft magnetic and hard magnetic materials, respectively. As a preconditioner an approximation of the Hessian of the Lagrangian is used, which only takes local field terms into account. Preconditioning requires a few additional sparse matrix vector multiplications per iteration of the nonlinear conjugate gradient method, which is used for minimizing the energy for a given external field. The time to solution for computing the demagnetization curve scales almost linearly with problem size.},

  abstract = {An equation of motion for the magnetization dynamics of systems with collinear or noncollinear magnetization is derived by a combination of the breathing Fermi surface model with a variant of the ab initio density functional electron theory given by the magnetic force theorem. The equation corresponds to a Gilbert equation with the constant Gilbert damping scalar a replaced by a nonlocal damping matrix \textbackslash underline\textbackslash underline\textbackslash alpha\_\textbackslash scriptsize\textbackslash hbox\textbackslash bit R,\textbackslash scriptsize\textbackslash hbox\textbackslash bit R' , which depends on the momentary orientation of all atomic magnetic moments in the system. For collinear situations this corresponds to an anisotropy of the damping because it depends on the orientation of the magnetization in the crystal, and for systems with atomic-scale noncollinearity such as extremely narrow domain walls or vortices the nonlocality is essential. The range of validity of the theory is discussed, and the predictions are compared with experimental observations. In particular, it is outlined how the prediction of anisotropic damping can be tested by ferromagnetic resonance experiments.}

We find a nontrivial configuration with fermion number whose energy is lower than the same number of free fermions quantized about the translationally invariant vacuum. In order to compute the quantum corrections for a given background field we use a phase-shift parameterization of the Casimir energy. We identify orders of the Born series for the phase shift with perturbative Feynman diagrams in order to renormalize the Casimir energy using perturbatively determined counterterms. Generalizing dimensional regularization, we demonstrate that this procedure yields a finite and unambiguous energy functional},

Using this model, the dependence of the image contrast on various experimental parameters was calculated analytically. The model was confirmed by means of calculations carried out by computer simulation of electron trajectories (Monte Carlo techniques). The theory accounts satisfactorily for previous experimental results. A more detailed comparison of the theory with experimental results will be published in a subsequent paper.}

The experiments include measurements of the contrast as a function of the voltage and angle of incidence of the incident electron beam and of the angle of rotation of the specimen about its surface normal. The results are in good agreement with the theory and confirm beyond doubt that type II contrast arises from the alteration of incident electron trajectories within the solid by the internal magnetic induction. Domain images obtained by the use of type II contrast can be interpreted on the basis of this mechanism.}

We show that Bloch point domain walls with chirality identical to that of the Oersted field can propagate without dynamical instabilities with velocities {$\sim$}300 m/s. The domain wall width is shown to widen at larger current densities limiting the velocity increase. For domain walls with opposite chirality, we observed a new pinning mechanism created by the action of the Oersted field, limiting their propagation distance even after chirality switching. Vortex\textendash antivortex domain walls transform into Bloch point domain walls, and after that they can unexpectedly propagate either along or against the direction of the current. Our findings demonstrate that domain wall dynamics under current in cylindrical magnetic nanowires can result in a plethora of different behaviors that will have important implications for future 3D spintronic devices.},

We discuss various properties of a single vortex, including its structure, energy, dynamics, normal modes, and stability, as well as vortex arrays. When the nonuniform condensate contains a vortex, the excitation spectrum includes unstable (`anomalous') mode(s) with negative frequency. Trap rotation shifts the normal-mode frequencies and can stabilize the vortex. We consider the effect of thermal quasiparticles on vortex normal modes as well as possible mechanisms for vortex dissipation. Vortex states in mixtures and spinor condensates are also discussed.}

  abstract = {The increasing information density in magnetic recording, the miniaturization in magnetic sensor technology, the trend towards nanocrystalline magnetic materials and the improved availability of large-scale computer power are the main reasons why micromagnetic modelling has been developing extremely rapidly. Computational micromagnetism leads to a deeper understanding of hysteresis effects by visualization of the magnetization reversal process. Recent advances in numerical simulation techniques are reviewed. Higher order finite elements and adaptive meshing have been introduced, in order to reduce the discretization error. The use of a hybrid boundary/finite element method enables accurate stray field computation for arbitrary shaped particles and takes into account the granular microstructure of the material. A dynamic micromagnetic code based on the Gilbert equation of motion to study the time evolution of the magnetization has been developed. Finite element models for different materials and magnet shapes are obtained from a Voronoi construction and subsequent meshing of the polyhedral regions. Adaptive refinement and coarsening of the finite element mesh guarantees accurate solutions near magnetic inhomogeneities or domain walls, while keeping the number of elements small. The polycrystalline microstructure and assumed random magnetocrystalline anisotropy of elongated Co elements decreases the coercive field and the switching time compared to zero anisotropy elements, in which vortices form and move only after a certain waiting time after the application of a reversed field close to the coercive field. NiFe elements with flat, rounded and slanted ends show different hysteresis properties and switching dynamics. Micromagnetic simulations show that the magnetic properties of intergranular regions in nucleation-controlled Nd-Fe-B hard magnetic materials control the coercive field. Exchange interactions between neighbouring soft and hard grains lead to remanence enhancement of isotropically oriented grains in nanocrystalline composite magnets. Upper limits of the coercive field of pinning-controlled Sm-Co magnets for high-temperature applications are predicted from the micromagnetic calculations. Incorporating thermally activated magnetization reversal and micromagnetics we found complex magnetization reversal mechanisms for small spherical magnetic particles. The magnetocrystalline anisotropy and the external field strength determine the switching mechanism. Three different regimes have been identified. For fields, which are smaller than the anisotropy field, magnetization by coherent switching has been observed. Single droplet nucleation occurs, if the external field is comparable to the anisotropy field, and multi-droplet nucleation is the driving reversal process for higher fields.}

  abstract = {Nanoscale magnetism is of paramount scientific interest and high technological relevance. To control magnetization on a nanoscale, both external magnetic fields and spin polarized currents, which generate a spin torque onto the local spin configuration, are being used. Novel ideas of manipulating the spins by electric fields or photons are emerging and benefit from advances in nano-preparation techniques of complex magnetic materials, such as multiferroics, ferromagnetic semiconductors, nanostructures, etc. Advanced analytical tools are needed for their characterization. Polarized soft X-rays using X-ray dichroism effects are used in a variety of spectroscopic and microscopic techniques capable of quantifying in an element, valence and site-sensitive way basic properties of ferro(i)- and antiferromagnetic systems, such as spin and orbital moments, nanoscale spin configurations and spin dynamics with sub-ns time resolution. Future X-ray sources, such as free electron lasers will provide an enormous increase in peak brilliance and open the fs time window to studies of magnetic materials. Thus fundamental magnetic time scales with nanometer spatial resolution can be addressed. This review provides an overview and future opportunities of analytical tools using polarized X-rays by selected examples of current research with advanced magnetic materials.},

We discuss these problems in the language of the CP1 non-relativistic model in 2+1 dimensions. The Noether procedure applied to the topologically non-trivial sector of this lagrangian model determines uniquely a well-defined linear and angular momentum. Surprisingly enough, translational invariance is broken by the topological charge. This phenomenon appears in 2+1 dimensions only for the non-relativistic version of the CP1 model.}

  abstract = {Abstract Using a framework of Dirac algebra, the Clifford algebra appropriate for Minkowski space-time, the formulation of classical electromagnetism including both electric and magnetic charge is explored. Employing the two-potential approach of Cabibbo and Ferrari, a Lagrangian is obtained that is dyality invariant and from which it is possible to derive by Hamilton's principle both the symmetrized Maxwell's equations and the equations of motion for both electrically and magnetically charged particles. This latter result is achieved by defining the variation of the action associated with the cross terms of the interaction Lagrangian in terms of a surface integral. The surface integral has an equivalent path-integral form, showing that the contribution of the cross terms is local in nature. The form of these cross terms derives in a natural way from a Dirac algebraic formulation, and, in fact, the use of the geometric product of Dirac algebra is an essential aspect of this derivation. No kinematic restrictions are associated with the derivation, and no relationship between magnetic and electric charge evolves from the (classical) formulation. However, it is indicated that in bound states quantum mechanical considerations will lead to a version of Dirac's quantization condition. A discussion of parity violation of the generalized electromagnetic theory is given, and a new approach to the incorporation of this violation into the formalism is suggested. Possibilities for extensions are mentioned.}

The curvature results in two additional effective interactions originated from exchange: one is analogue of magnetic anisotropy, another one is analogue of Dzyaloshinskii interaction. Equilibrium state of the curvilinear magnetic nanoshel with easy-surface anisotropy can be understood as a competition between these effective interactions. As an illustration of our method we consider statics and dynamics of a truncated cone magnetic surface. To single out the curvature effects we study the continuous transition from planar ring to a cylinder surface by varying the inclination angle of the cone generatrix from 0 to \$\textbackslash pi/2\$.}

Starting with the linear case we derive exact as well as approximate expressions for the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the linear problem. We then proceed to the nonlinear setting and its stationary states in a number of limiting cases that allow for analytical treatment. The results of our analysis are used as initial conditions in direct numerical simulations of the nonlinear problem and in this case localized excitations are found to persist. We found also interesting relaxational dynamics. Analogies of the present problem in context related to atomic physics and particularly to Bose-Einstein condensation are discussed.}

  abstract = {A ribbon is a surface swept out by a line segment turning as it moves along a central curve. For narrow magnetic ribbons, for which the length of the line segment is much less than the length of the curve, the anisotropy induced by the magnetostatic interaction is biaxial, with hard axis normal to the ribbon and easy axis along the central curve. The micromagnetic energy of a narrow ribbon reduces to that of a one-dimensional ferromagnetic wire, but with curvature, torsion and local anisotropy modified by the rate of turning. These general results are applied to two examples, namely a helicoid ribbon, for which the central curve is a straight line, and a M\"obius ribbon, for which the central curve is a circle about which the line segment executes a 180\textsuperscript{0} twist. In both examples, for large positive tangential anisotropy, the ground state magnetization lies tangent to the central curve. As the tangential anisotropy is decreased, the ground state magnetization undergoes a transition, acquiring an in-surface component perpendicular to the central curve. For the helicoid ribbon, the transition occurs at vanishing anisotropy, below which the ground state is uniformly perpendicular to the central curve. The transition for the M\"obius ribbon is more subtle; it occurs at a positive critical value of the anisotropy, below which the ground state is nonuniform. For the helicoid ribbon, the dispersion law for spin wave excitations about the tangential state is found to exhibit an asymmetry determined by the geometric and magnetic chiralities.},

The collective variables that describe radially symmetric oscillations of the magnetization dynamics for particles in the vortex state are introduced, and the dependence of the particle energy is studied as a function of these variables. The analytical expressions describing the frequency of magnetization oscillations with a radial symmetry, including nonlinear oscillations, are derived using the collective variables. It is shown that the presence of a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the particle plane reduces the oscillation frequency and can lead to hybridization of this mode with other modes of spin oscillations, including the mode of translational oscillations of the vortex core. The soliton solutions describing the propagation of collective oscillations along the chain of magnetic particles are found.}

  abstract = {Abstract Semiclassical dynamics of magnetic vortices in 2D lattice models of easy-plane ferromagnets is investigated. It is shown that the low-energy part of the spectrum of vortices treated as quantum excitations of the system exhibits a nontrivial structure. The simplest spectrum is observed for standard magnetic vortices, in which magnetization at long distances from the center of a vortex is parallel to the basal plane. In this case, the spectrum has a band structure consisting of several nonintersecting bands, whose number is determined only by the value of atomic spin S and lattice symmetry. For purely 2D magnets with a single spin per unit cell, the number of bands is S or 2S for integral and half-integral values of spin S, respectively. For a lattice with the basis with an even number 2n of spins per unit cell, the number of bands is 2nS for any spins. The situation radically changes for vortices in the cone state as compared to standard vortices, for which the magnetization at a long distance from the center of a vortex rotates in the easy plane of the magnet. Vortices in the cone state are formed under the action of a constant external field perpendicular to the easy plane of the magnet. As a rule, the spectrum for such vortices is not a standard band spectrum and forms a set such that a forbidden energy value can be found in any small neighborhood of an allowed value, and vice versa. The possibility of an oscillatory motion of a vortex under the action of a constant external force is indicated (analog of Bloch oscillations of electrons in crystals). Possible realization of these effects in other ordered media with vortices is considered.}

  abstract = {Frequency nonreciprocity of wave phenomena describes the situation where the wave dispersion depends on the sign of the wave vector, i.e., counterpropagating waves exhibit different wavelengths for the same frequency. Such behavior has recently been observed in heavy-metal-ferromagnetic interfaces with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling, and is also known for coupled magnetic bilayers, where the nonreciprocity is enhanced when the two layers are aligned antiparallel. Besides the conventional uses of spin waves, nonreciprocity adds further functionalities, such as its potential applications in communication technologies and logic operations. In the current paper, we thus examine the spin-wave nonreciprocity induced by dipolar interactions in a coupled bilayer consisting of two ferromagnetic layers separated by a nonmagnetic spacer. We derive an easy-to-use formula to estimate the frequency difference provided by the nonreciprocity, which allows one to choose an optimal system in order to maximize the effect. For small wave numbers, the nonreciprocity scales linearly, while for larger wave vectors the nonreciprocity behaves nonmonotonically, with a well-defined maximum. The study is carried out by means of analytical calculations that are complemented by micromagnetic simulations. Furthermore, we confirm our model by experimental investigation of the spin-wave dispersion in a prototype antiparallel-coupled bilayer system. Since the relative magnetic orientation can be controlled through a bias field, the magnon nonreciprocity can then be turned on and off, which lends an important functionality to the coupled ferromagnetic bilayers.},

The core is composed of a complex of the NC (nucleocapsid) protein and genomic RNA, surrounded by a shell of the CA (capsid) protein. A method was developed for assembling cones in vitro using pure recombinant HIV-1 CA-NC fusion proteins and RNA templates. These synthetic cores are capped at both ends and appear similar in size and morphology to authentic viral cores. It is proposed that both viral and synthetic cores are organized on conical hexagonal lattices, which by Euler's theorem requires quantization of their cone angles. Electron microscopic analyses revealed that the cone angles of synthetic cores were indeed quantized into the five allowed angles. The viral core and most synthetic cones exhibited cone angles of approximately 19 degrees (the narrowest of the allowed angles). These observations suggest that the core of HIV is organized on the principles of a fullerene cone, in analogy to structures recently observed for elemental carbon.}

Our method dynamically assigns different numbers of rows to each thread block and executes different optimization implementations on the basis of the number of rows it involves for each block. The process of accesses to the CSR arrays is fully coalesced, and the GPU's DRAM bandwidth is efficiently utilized by loading data into the shared memory, which alleviates the bottleneck of many existing CSR-based algorithms (i.e., CSR-scalar and CSR-vector). Test results on C2050 and K20c GPUs show that our method outperforms a perfect-CSR algorithm that inspires our work, the vendor tuned CUSPARSE V6.5 and CUSP V0.5.1, and three popular algorithms clSpMV, CSR5, and CSR-Adaptive.},

  abstract = {Magnetic materials hosting correlated electrons play an important role for information technology and signal processing. The currently used ferro-, ferri- and antiferromagnetic materials provide microscopic moments (spins) that are mainly collinear. Recently more complex spin structures such as spin helices and cycloids have regained a lot of interest. The interest has been initiated by the discovery of the skyrmion lattice phase in non-centrosymmetric helical magnets. In this review we address how spin helices and skyrmion lattices enrich the microwave characteristics of magnetic materials and give rise to bottom-up magnonic crystals. When discussing perspectives for microwave electronics and magnonics we focus particularly on insulating materials as they avoid eddy current losses, offer low spin-wave damping, and allow for electric field control. Thereby, they further fuel the vision of magnonics operated at low energy consumption.},

  abstract = {Preconditioned Krylov subspace (KSP) methods are widely used for solving large-scale sparse linear systems arising from numerical solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs). These linear systems are often nonsymmetric due to the nature of the PDEs, boundary or jump conditions, or discretization methods. While implementations of preconditioned KSP methods are usually readily available, it is unclear to users which methods are the best for different classes of problems. In this work, we present a comparison of some KSP methods, including GMRES, TFQMR, BiCGSTAB, and QMRCGSTAB, coupled with three classes of preconditioners, namely, Gauss\textendash Seidel, incomplete LU factorization (including ILUT, ILUTP, and multilevel ILU), and algebraic multigrid (including BoomerAMG and ML). Theoretically, we compare the mathematical formulations and operation counts of these methods. Empirically, we compare the convergence and serial performance for a range of benchmark problems from numerical PDEs in two and three dimensions with up to millions of unknowns and also assess the asymptotic complexity of the methods as the number of unknowns increases. Our results show that GMRES tends to deliver better performance when coupled with an effective multigrid preconditioner, but it is less competitive with an ineffective preconditioner due to restarts. BoomerAMG with a proper choice of coarsening and interpolation techniques typically converges faster than ML, but both may fail for ill-conditioned or saddle-point problems, whereas multilevel ILU tends to succeed. We also show that right preconditioning is more desirable. This study helps establish some practical guidelines for choosing preconditioned KSP methods and motivates the development of more effective preconditioners.},

The magnetic parameters extracted from the position of the spin-wave resonance peaks are very close to those tabulated for bulk iron. From the zero-current propagating wave forms, a group velocity of 4 km/s and an attenuation length of about 6 {$\mu$}m are extracted for 1.6-{$\mu$}m-wavelength spin wave at 18 GHz. From the measured current-induced spin-wave Doppler shift, we extract a surprisingly high degree of spin polarization of the current of 83\%, which constitutes the main finding of this work. This set of results makes single-crystalline iron a promising candidate for building devices utilizing high-frequency spin waves and spin-polarized currents.},

We have investigated the energetic aspect of the vortex core reversal in ferromagnetic thin-film elements by means of fully three-dimensional finite-element micromagnetic simulations. The simulations show that the reversal occurs once a well-defined threshold in the exchange energy density is reached. We establish the energetic origin of the core reversal by demonstrating that this threshold corresponds to the energy necessary for the production of a vortex-antivortex pair. The effect of the discretization size on the computed exchange energy of a magnetic singularity is discussed. Such a singularity is required for the core reversal process to unfold.}

  abstract = {The micromagnetic equations which govern the magnetisation distribution have been studied analytically for nano-sized magnets. By exploiting the fact that in such magnets the magnetisation is near-uniform these equations can be linearised. The problem then reduces to the solution of two uncoupled Poisson equations with given source terms subject to certain surface boundary conditions. These source terms are particularly simple and have analytical forms when one restricts the analysis to rectangular nanomagnets. Solutions to the Poisson equations have been found analytically by expansion in Fourier series which automatically satisfies the boundary conditions. The total energies obtained using these Fourier solutions are compared with the energies obtained from numerical solutions to the full non-linear micromagnetic equations in the case of square cross-section nanomagnets (the only case that has been considered numerically) and shown to be in agreement to the order of a few percent. These solutions may now be used to calculate the total energy in the presence of an external magnetic field and in this way extend the Stoner-Wohlfarth theory to near-uniformly magnetised rectangular bodies.},

Lateral system of magnonic stripes with a piezoelectric layer is fabricated and tested with microwave and Brillouin light scattering spectroscopy. The mechanisms of controlling the dipole coupling of spin waves by elastic strains localized in the region of maximums of the electric field strength are revealed. It is shown that when the absolute value and sign of the electric field are changed, it is possible to effectively control the properties of the propagating spin waves and the spatial distribution of the intensity of the dynamic magnetization in the lateral structure. We emphasize that the spin-wave intermodal coupling can be tuned with the external electric field in the adjacent magnonic stripes. Formation of channel for spin-wave edge mode propagation is observed experimentally in the vicinity of the gap between adjacent stripes. Effective control of the spin-wave coupling by changing the gap is demonstrated. From an applied point of view, the results can be used in information processing devices with electric and magnetic field tunability.},

  abstract = {The Casimir problem is usually posed as the response of a fluctuating quantum field to externally imposed boundary conditions. In reality, however, no interaction is strong enough to enforce a boundary condition on all frequencies of a fluctuating field. We construct a more physical model of the situation by coupling the fluctuating field to a smooth background potential that implements the boundary condition in a certain limit. To study this problem, we develop general new methods to compute renormalized one-loop quantum energies and energy densities. We use analytic properties of scattering data to compute Green's functions in time-independent background fields at imaginary momenta. Our calculational method is particularly useful for numerical studies of singular limits because it avoids terms that oscillate or require cancellation of exponentially growing and decaying factors. To renormalize, we identify potentially divergent contributions to the Casimir energy with low orders in the Born series to the Green's function. We subtract these contributions and add back the corresponding Feynman diagrams, which we combine with counterterms fixed by imposing standard renormalization conditions on low-order Green's functions. The resulting Casimir energy and energy density are finite functionals for smooth background potentials. In general, however, the Casimir energy diverges in the boundary condition limit. This divergence is real and reflects the infinite energy needed to constrain a fluctuating field on all energy scales; renormalizable quantum field theories have no place for ad hoc surface counterterms. We apply our methods to simple examples to illustrate cases where these subtleties invalidate the conclusions of the boundary condition approach.},

As a result, the Casimir energy of the surface and other quantities like the surface tension, which are obtained by deforming the surface, cannot be defined independently of the details of the coupling between the field and the matter on the surface. In contrast, the energy density away from the surface and the force between rigid surfaces are finite and independent of these complications.}

  abstract = {Casimir forces are conventionally computed by analyzing the effects of boundary conditions on a fluctuating quantum field. Although this analysis provides a clean and calculationally tractable idealization, it does not always accurately capture the characteristics of real materials, which cannot constrain the modes of the fluctuating field at all energies. We study the vacuum polarization energy of renormalizable, continuum quantum field theory in the presence of a background field, designed to impose a Dirichlet boundary condition in a particular limit. We show that in two and three space dimensions, as a background field becomes concentrated on the surface on which the Dirichlet boundary condition would eventually hold, the Casimir energy diverges. This result implies that the energy depends in detail on the properties of the material, which are not captured by the idealized boundary conditions. This divergence does not affect the force between rigid bodies, but it does invalidate calculations of Casimir stresses based on idealized boundary conditions.},

The method uses the effective potential as an auxiliary step to ensure that the soliton is quantized around the appropriate vacuum. The exact result is then computed using scattering theory techniques, and includes all orders in the derivative expansion. It can be efficiently combined with a calculation of the exact quantum correction to yield the full free energy to one loop. I demonstrate this technique with explicit computations in [phi]4 models, obtaining the free energy for a kink in 1+1 dimensions and a domain wall in 2+1 dimensions.}

Our calculation uses scattering data from the potential induced by the flux tube and imposes standard perturbative renormalization conditions. The calculation is exact to one-loop order, with no additional approximation adopted. We embed the flux tube in a configuration with zero total flux so that we can fully apply standard results from scattering theory. We find that upon choosing the same on-shell renormalization conditions, the functional dependence of the energy and energy density on the parameters of the flux tube is very similar for three and four spacetime dimensions. We compare our exact results to those obtained from the derivative and perturbation expansion approximations, and find good agreement for appropriate parameters of the flux tube. This remedies some puzzles in the prior literature.},

  abstract = {The performance of sparse matrix vector multiplication (SpMV) is important to computational scientists. Compressed sparse row (CSR) is the most frequently used format to store sparse matrices. However, CSR-based SpMV on graphics processing units (GPUs) has poor performance due to irregular memory access patterns, load imbalance, and reduced parallelism. This has led researchers to propose new storage formats. Unfortunately, dynamically transforming CSR into these formats has significant runtime and storage overheads. We propose a novel algorithm, CSR-Adaptive, which keeps the CSR format intact and maps well to GPUs. Our implementation addresses the aforementioned challenges by (i) efficiently accessing DRAM by streaming data into the local scratchpad memory and (ii) dynamically assigning different numbers of rows to each parallel GPU compute unit. CSR-Adaptive achieves an average speedup of 14.7\texttimes{} over existing CSR-based algorithms and 2.3\texttimes{} over clSpMV cocktail, which uses an assortment of matrix formats.},

  abstract = {Magnonic crystals can be regarded as the magnetic counterpart of photonic crystals, with spin waves acting as information carriers. Thus, magnonic crystals are magnetic materials with periodic distribution of the constituents or periodic modulation of some magnetic parameters (e.g., saturation magnetization or magnetocrystalline anisotropy), or other parameters relevant to the propagation of spin waves (e.g., external magnetic field, film thickness, stress, or a surrounding of the homogeneous ferromagnetic film). The spin waves propagating in magnonic crystal have a form of Bloch waves, and the dispersion relation includes frequency bands allowing spin wave propagation and frequency band gaps, forbidden for spin wave propagation. By adjusting relevant parameters of the magnonic crystal or external fields, the spectrum of spin waves can be tuned and the flow of spin waves can be tailored in the way unavailable with homogeneous media. The new physical effects occurring in magnetic nanostructures with periodic pattern and prospective applications of magnonic crystals, especially in integrated microwave devices and for processing information at microwave frequencies, drive the new fields of magnonics and magnon spintronics.},

  abstract = {The nonuniform magnetic vortex gyrotropic oscillations along the cylindrical dot thickness were calculated. A generalized Thiele equation was used for describing the vortex core motion including magnetostatic and exchange forces. The magnetostatic interaction was accounted for in a local form. This allowed reducing the Thiele equation of motion to the Schr\"odinger differential equation and analytically determining the spin eigenmode spatial profiles and eigenfrequencies using the Liouville\textendash Green method for the high-frequency modes. The mapping of the Schr\"odinger equation to the Mathieu equation was used for the low-frequency gyrotropic mode. The lowest-frequency gyrotropic mode transformed to the dot faces localized mode, increasing the dot thickness. The vortex gyrotropic modes are described for a wide range of the dot thicknesses according to the concept of the turning points in the magnetostatic potential. This approach allows treating the vortex localized modes (turning points) and nonlocalized modes within a unified picture.},

  abstract = {Magnetic vortices are typically the ground states in geometrically confined ferromagnets with small magnetocrystalline anisotropy. In this article I review static and dynamic properties of the magnetic vortex state in small particles with nanoscale thickness and sub-micron and micron lateral sizes (magnetic dots). Magnetic dots made of soft magnetic material shaped as flat circular and elliptic cylinders are considered. Such mesoscopic dots undergo magnetization reversal through successive nucleation, displacement and annihilation of magnetic vortices. The reversal process depends on the stability of different possible zero-field magnetization configurations with respect to the dot geometrical parameters and application of an external magnetic field. The interdot magnetostatic interaction plays an important role in magnetization reversal for dot arrays with a small dot-to-dot distance, leading to decreases in the vortex nucleation and annihilation fields. Magnetic vortices reveal rich, non-trivial dynamical properties due to existance of the vortex core bearing topological charges. The vortex ground state magnetization distribution leads to a considerable modification of the nature of spin excitations in comparison to those in the uniformly magnetized state. A magnetic vortex confined in a magnetically soft ferromagnet with micron-sized lateral dimensions possesses a characteristic dynamic excitation known as a translational mode that corresponds to spiral-like precession of the vortex core around its equilibrium position. The translation motions of coupled vortices are considered. There are, above the vortex translation mode eigenfrequencies, several dynamic magnetization eigenmodes localized outside the vortex core whose frequencies are determined principally by dynamic demagnetizing fields appearing due to restricted dot geometry. The vortex excitation modes are classified as translation modes and radially or azimuthally symmetric spin waves over the vortex ground state. Studying the spin eigenmodes in such systems provides valuable information to relate the particle dynamical response to geometrical parameters. Unresolved problems are identified to attract attention of researchers working in the area of nanomagnetism.}

  abstract = {Current-induced torques (CITs) on ferromagnetic (FM) nanoparticles and on domain walls in FM nanowires are normally understood in terms of transfer of conserved spin angular momentum between spin-polarized currents and the magnetic condensate. In a series of recent articles, we have discussed a microscopic picture of CITs in which they are viewed as following from exchange fields produced by the misaligned spins of current carrying quasiparticles. This picture has the advantage that it can be applied to systems in which spin is not approximately conserved. More importantly, this point of view makes it clear that CITs can also act on the order parameter of an antiferromagnetic (AFM) metal, even though this quantity is not related to total spin. In this informal and intentionally provocative review we explain this picture and discuss its application to antiferromagnets.},

It provides a historical background and literature survey, but focuses on recent progress, identifying the most exciting new scientific results and pointing to promising future research directions. It starts with an introduction and overview of how basic magnetic properties are affected by interfaces, then turns to a discussion of charge and spin transport through and near interfaces and how these can be used to control the properties of the magnetic layer. Important concepts include spin accumulation, spin currents, spin transfer torque, and spin pumping. An overview is provided to the current state of knowledge and existing review literature on interfacial effects such as exchange bias, exchange spring magnets, spin Hall effect, oxide heterostructures, and topological insulators. The article highlights recent discoveries of interface-induced magnetism and non-collinear spin textures, non-linear dynamics including spin torque transfer and magnetization reversal induced by interfaces, and interfacial effects in ultrafast magnetization processes.},

The spin-wave amplitude was measured using a frequency-resolved magneto optical network analyzer, allowing for high-resolution resonance curves to be recorded. It was found that with increasing excitation amplitude up to about 10 mT, the lowest-order mode behaves strongly non-linearly as the mode frequency redshifts and the resonance peak strongly deforms. This behavior was quantitatively reproduced by micromagnetic simulations. At higher excitation the spinwaves are transformed into a soliton by self-focusing, and collapse onto the vortex core, dispersing the energy in short-wavelength spinwaves. Additionally, this process can lead to switching of the vortex polarization through the injection of a Bloch point.}

However, CSR-based SpMVs on graphic processing units (GPUs), for example, CSR-scalar and CSR-vector, usually have poor performance due to irregular memory access patterns. This motivates us to propose a perfect CSR-based SpMV on the GPU that is called PCSR. PCSR involves two kernels and accesses CSR arrays in a fully coalesced manner by introducing a middle array, which greatly alleviates the deficiencies of CSR-scalar (rare coalescing) and CSR-vector (partial coalescing). Test results on a single C2050 GPU show that PCSR fully outperforms CSR-scalar, CSR-vector, and CSRMV and HYBMV in the vendor-tuned CUSPARSE library and is comparable with a most recently proposed CSR-based algorithm, CSR-Adaptive. Furthermore, we extend PCSR on a single GPU to multiple GPUs. Experimental results on four C2050 GPUs show that no matter whether the communication between GPUs is considered or not PCSR on multiple GPUs achieves good performance and has high parallel efficiency.},

The model takes into account both short range exchange interactions and long range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter are accounted for through plane-wave dynamic demagnetization factors, which depend not only on the geometry and relative positions of the magnetic cells, as usual demagnetization factors do, but also on the wave vector of the propagating waves. Such a numerical model is most relevant when the spin-wave medium is spatially inhomogeneous perpendicular to the direction of propagation, either in its magnetic properties or in its equilibrium magnetic configuration. We illustrate this point by studying surface spin-waves in magnetic bilayer films and spin-waves channelized along magnetic domain walls in perpendicularly magnetized strips. In both cases, dynamic dipolar interactions produce non-reciprocity effects, where counter-propagative spin-waves have different frequencies.},

  abstract = {The one-dimensional problem of a static head-to-head domain wall structure in a thin soft-magnetic nanowire with circular cross-section is treated within the framework of micromagnetic theory. A radius-dependent analytic form of the domain wall profile is derived by decomposing the magnetostatic energy into a monopolar and a dipolar term. We present a model in which the dipolar term of the magnetostatic energy resulting from the transverse magnetization in the center of the domain wall is calculated with Osborn's formulas for homogeneously magnetized ellipsoids [Phys. Rev. 67, 351 (1945)]. The analytic results agree almost perfectly with simulation data as long as the wire diameter is sufficiently small to prevent inhomogeneities of the magnetization along the cross-section. Owing to the recently demonstrated negligible D\"oring mass of these walls, our results should also apply to the dynamic case, where domain walls are driven by spin-transfer toque effects and/or an axial magnetic field.}

The established finite element/boundary element method (FEM/BEM) by Fredkin and Koehler (1990) involves a densely populated matrix with unacceptable numerical costs for problems with a large number of degrees of freedom N. By using hierarchical matrices of H 2 type, we show that the memory requirements of this FEM/BEM method can be reduced dramatically, effectively converting the quadratic complexity O(N 2 ) of the problem to a linear one O(N). We obtain matrix size reductions of nearly 99\% in test cases with more than 10 6 degrees of freedom, and we test the computed magnetostatic energy values by means of comparison with analytic values. The efficiency of the H 2 -matrix compression opens the way to large-scale magnetostatic field calculations in micromagnetic modeling, all while preserving the accuracy of the established FEM/BEM formalism.},

One of the most successful base-models having stable knots is the Faddeev\cyrchar\cyrv\textendash Skyrme model and it is expected to be contained in some of these experimentally relevant models. The taxonomy of knotted topological solitons (Hopfions) of this model is known. In this paper, we describe some aspects of the dynamics of Hopfions and show that they indeed behave like particles: during scattering the Hopf charge is conserved and bound states are formed when the dynamics allows it. We have also investigated the dynamical stability of a pair of Hopfions in stacked or side-by-side configurations, whose theoretical stability has recently been discussed by Ward.}

A magnetic fourfold anisotropy was found for the lattice with dot diameters of 1 [mu]m and a dot separation of 0.1 [mu]m.

Depending on the thermal and magnetic history, a variety of different effects can be observed. Thermal annealing in a saturating magnetic field establishes a spatially homogeneous exchange bias with a uniform unidirectional anisotropy. This results in an angular dependence of the magnetization reversal mode, which can be either via magnetization rotation or vortex nucleation and annihilation. In contrast, thermal annealing in a field smaller than the vortex annihilation field imprints the ferromagnetic vortex configuration in the antiferromagnet with high fidelity resulting in unusual asymmetric hysteresis loops. Furthermore, we discuss how the interfacial nature of the exchange bias can modify the vortex magnetization along the thickness of the ferromagnet.},

The basis of the treatment is the exchange interaction model amplified by explicit consideration of the dipole-dipole interaction between the atomic magnets. Approximations appropriate to low temperatures and equivalent to those used by Bloch in his derivation of the T1 law, are introduced. The resultant expression for the intrinsic volume susceptibility decreases slowly with increasing field; at high fields the functional dependence is as the inverse square root of the field. The variation with temperature is linear; at room temperature and for fields of about 4000 gauss, the order of magnitude of the (volume) susceptibility is 10-4. The results are compared with experiment and satisfactory agreement is found.}

It was shown that bifurcation cascades can be obtained either by tuning the injected spin-polarized current or by changing the magnitude of applied magnetic field. The order\textendash chaos transition in magnetization dynamics can be also directly observed from the hysteresis curves. The resulting complex oscillations are useful for development of spin-valve devices operating in harmonic and chaotic modes.},

While previous spin-transfer oscillators (STOs) were based on in-plane magnetized structures, here we present the realization of an STO that contains a perpendicular spin current polarizer combined with an in-plane magnetized free layer. This device is characterized by high-frequency oscillations of the free-layer magnetization, consistent with out-of-plane steady-state precessions induced at the threshold current by a spin-transfer torque from perpendicularly polarized electrons. The results are summarized in static and dynamic current-field state diagrams and will be of importance for the design of STOs with enhanced output signals.}

From their discovery in the 1970s for bubble memory devices to their modern application as radio frequency oscillators, magnetic vortices have been adopted to modern telecommunication and sensor applications. Basic properties of vortex structures in the static and dynamic regime, from a theoretical and experimental point of view, are presented as well as their application in spin torque driven nano-pillar and magnetic tunnel junction devices. Single vortex excitations and phase locking phenomena of coupled oscillators are discussed with an outlook of vortex oscillators in magnetic hybrid structures with imprinted domain confinement and dynamic encryption devices.}

They offer non-volatile storage, fast switching times, efficient operation and a bistable magnetic configuration that are convenient for representing digital information. Key to this is the high level of control that is possible over the position and behaviour of domain walls (DWs) in magnetic nanowires. Magnetic random access memory based on the propagation of DWs in nanowires has been released commercially, while more dynamic shift register memory and logic circuits have been demonstrated. Here, we discuss the present standing of this technology as well as reviewing some of the basic DW effects that have been observed and the underlying physics of DW motion. We also discuss the future direction of magnetic nanowire technology to look at possible developments, hurdles to overcome and what nanowire devices may appear in the future, both in classical information technology and beyond into quantum computation and biology.}

Here, we demonstrate that local electric fields can be used to reversibly switch between a magnetic skyrmion and the ferromagnetic state. These two states are topologically inequivalent, and we find that the direction of an electric field directly determines the final state. This observation establishes the possibility to combine energy-efficient electric field writing with the recently envisaged skyrmion racetrack-type memories.}

  abstract = {Magnetic skyrmions are swirling spin structures stabilized typically by the Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The existing control of magnetic skyrmions has often relied on the use of an electric current, which may cause overheating in densely packed devices. Here we demonstrate, using phase-field simulations, that an isolated N\'eel skyrmion in a magnetic nanodisk can be repeatedly created and deleted by voltage-induced strains from a juxtaposed piezoelectric. Such a skyrmion switching is non-volatile, and consumes only \$\textbackslash sim\$0.5 fJ per switching which is about five orders of magnitude smaller than that by current-induced spin-transfer-torques. It is found that the strain-mediated skyrmion creation occurs through an intermediate vortex-like spin structure, and that the skyrmion deletion occurs though a homogenous shrinkage during which the N\'eel wall is temporarily transformed to a vortex-wall. These findings are expected to stimulate experimental research into strain-mediated voltage control of skyrmions, as well as other chiral spin structures for low-power spintronics.}

Theoretically we find that this high efficiency arises from the surface torques exerted by the absorbed spin current that lead to efficient depinning.},

We also study the interaction and scattering of two solitons, through a numerical simulation of the (3+1)-dimensional equations of motion.

However, the nonreciprocal frequency shifts demonstrated so far are not large enough for applications because they originate from interfacial effects. In addition, switching of the spin wave nonreciprocity in the electrical way remains a challenging issue. Here, we show a switchable giant nonreciprocal frequency shift of propagating spin waves in interlayer exchange\textendash coupled synthetic antiferromagnets. The observed frequency shift is attributed to large asymmetric spin wave dispersion caused by a mutual dipolar interaction between two magnetic layers. Furthermore, we find that the sign of the frequency shift depends on relative configuration of two magnetizations, based on which we demonstrate an electrical switching of the nonreciprocity. Our findings provide a route for switchable and highly nonreciprocal spin wave\textendash based applications.},

  abstract = {The coherent quantum tunneling effects in antiferromagnets in the presence of a strong external magnetic field parallel to the easy axis have been investigated using the instanton formalism. In a wide field range including the region of the phase spin-flop transition, the tunneling is described by 180\cyrchar\CYRV\textdegree{} instantons for which the Euclidean action is real and destructive interference is absent. At the transition point, 90\cyrchar\CYRV\textdegree{} instantons describing the tunneling between the collinear and spin-flop states appear. The Euclidean action decreases, whereas the tunneling probability and tunneling level splitting in both phases increase significantly in the immediate vicinity of the spin-flop transition point. The possibility of observing the coherent tunneling effects for artificial small particles (magnetic dots) made of antiferromagnets is discussed.}

Apart from the Goldstone mode a second local mode which is due to the coupling between in-plane and out-of-plane spin components has been derived. For typical experimental conditions in a model system like (TMMC) the frequency of this mode is very close to the bottom of the magnon band. Considering both a twofold and a weak sixfold in-plane crystal field anisotropy we found that close to the spin-flop transition the separation of this local mode from the magnon band is increased and dramatically affected by the sixfold anisotropy. We show that quantum properties of this mode are not important.}

These simulations correspond to the most commonly reported electrodeposited nanowires, based on permalloy, nickel, iron and cobalt, with crystal structure tailored by electrodeposition parameters. The dependence of coercivity and remanence on the nanowire diameter, the angular dependence of coercivity and the corresponding reversal modes are calculated and discussed. Extensive comparison of the obtained coercive field value with available experimental data is presented. Depending on the crystallographic structure, the nanowires reverse magnetization by transverse or vortex domain walls and can exhibit the vortex structure along the whole nanowire length. The state diagrams for reversal modes in different materials as a function of the exchange correlation length, nanowire diameter and the anisotropy direction are presented. Magnetic force microscopy images corresponding to different structures are also evaluated by the micromagnetic simulations.},

  abstract = {The ground state of nonellipsoidal particles can be inhomogeneous due tothe effect of a demagnetizing field. The approach proposed here for studyingsuch particles is based on the combination of symmetry analysis and perturbationtheory. The general formulation of this approach, which makes it possibleto analyze weakly inhomogeneous states for particles with a complex shape,is considered. The ground state of cubic particles of magnetically softmaterials is calculated analytically, and the effect of small strains ofcubic particles on the magnetization distribution in the particles is investigated.It is shown for the example of magnetically soft cubic particles that evena small deviation of the particle shape from symmetrical may result inthe realization of a special magnetic state in such particles, in whichthe symmetry in the magnetization distribution is lower than the particlesymmetry. A change in the parameters of a particle can substantially modifyits magnetic properties and may even induce a phase transition to a statewith a different symmetry.}

Under the action of field pulses with a duration of the order of 10\cyrchar\cyrv\cyrchar\CYRDJE ``100 ps, the vortex undergoes a complex motion. The analysis of the results of a micromagnetic simulation indicates that this motion is non-Newtonian. It can be described by an equation containing the third time derivative of the displacement of the vortex core.}

Topological classification, structure, dynamical properties and thermodynamical contribution of 2D solitons to response functions of the magnet are discussed. Based on effective equations of motion we calculated the soliton contribution to the dynamical structure factor of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets both for localized topological solitons and magnetic vortices.}

  abstract = {The dynamical properties of topological precessional solitons in two-dimensional ferromagnets with uniaxial anisotropy are considered. It turns out that free (without external forces acting) soliton motion corresponds to some rotary motion (analogous to Larmor precession of a charged particle in an external magnetic field). The effective mass of the soliton is found. It is shown that the denominator of the mass value contains the anisotropy constant, so in the isotropic ferromagnet the topological soliton motion is impossible.}

We study the Casimir energy in a toy model, where the classical field is replaced by a separable potential. In this model the exact answer is trivial to compute, making it a good place to examine subtleties of the problem. We construct two traditional representations of the Casimir energy, one from the Green's function and the other from the phase shifts, and apply them to this case. We show that the two representations are correct and equivalent in this model. We study the convergence of the Born approximation to the Casimir energy and relate our findings to computational issues that arise in more realistic models.}

Using magnetic force microscopy (MFM) we observed that for geometrically identical ellipsoidal nanomagnets the magnetic states at remanence are strongly dependent on the arrangement of the ellipsoid due to competition between the inherent shape and configuration anisotropies. When the elements are coupled along the major axis, the individual elements adopt a single domain magnetic state at remanence for field applied along the linear chain. This is in contrast with a wide range of magnetic states (single vortex states, double vortex states and modified single domain states) observed for elements coupled along the minor axis and also isolated elements. We have conducted a detailed investigation on the magnetization reversal mechanisms for both configurations and have correlated our experimental results with micromagnetic simulations.}

  abstract = {Abstract             NiFe-based vortex spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNO) have been shown to be rich dynamic systems which can operate as efficient frequency generators and detectors, but with a limitation in frequency determined by the gyrotropic frequency, typically sub-GHz. In this report, we present a detailed analysis of the nature of the higher order spin wave modes which exist in the Super High Frequency range (3\textendash 30\,GHz). This is achieved via micromagnetic simulations and electrical characterisation in magnetic tunnel junctions, both directly via the spin-diode effect and indirectly via the measurement of the coupling with the gyrotropic critical current. The excitation mechanism and spatial profile of the modes are shown to have a complex dependence on the vortex core position. Additionally, the inter-mode coupling between the fundamental gyrotropic mode and the higher order modes is shown to reduce or enhance the effective damping depending upon the sense of propagation of the confined spin wave.},

All ofthe dots had the same radius 0.5 mkm, thickness 5070 nm, and were arrangedinto rectangular or square array with different interdot separations. Inthe case of perpendicular magnetization multiple (up to 8) sharp resonancepeaks were observed below the main FMR peak, and the relative positionsof these peaks were independent of the interdot separations. Quantitativedescription of the observed multiresonance FMR spectra is given using thedipole-exchange spin wave dispersion equation for a perpendicularly magnetizedfilm where in-plane wave vector is quantized due to the finite dot radius,and the inhomogenetiy of the intradot static demagnetization field in thenonellipsoidal dot is taken into account.}

To date, work in this area has focused on one-dimensional topologies based on purely magnetic thin-film transmission systems, typically exploiting interference phenomena to perform logical operations. In this paper, we describe an alternative approach in which spinmechatronic structures combining spin-wave transmission systems with magnetically loaded micro- and nano-mechanical elements provide spin-information processing functionality.}

The method is based on excluding the centrifugal potential from the quasiclassical momentum and changing correspondingly the phase in the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition. MQM is used to calculate the asymptotic coefficients at zero and at infinity. We use the examples of power-law and funnel potentials to show that MQM not only dramatically broadens the possibilities of studying the energy spectrum and the wave functions analytically but also ensures accuracy to within a few percent even when one calculates states with a radial quantum number n}

Magnetoresistance measurements under the AC current revealed that the annihilation field of the vortex core is reduced in the resonance state compared to the off-resonance state. This may be due to the additional energy accompanying the resonant motion.},

Furthermore, a vortex state located at the center of the cloud first becomes locally stable as the rotational frequency increases. Finally our study implies the existence of hysteresis effects.}

  abstract = {The ultrafast (sub-nanosecond) magnetization dynamics of ferromagnetic thin films and elements that find application in spintronic devices is reviewed. The major advances in the understanding of magnetization dynamics in the two decades since the discovery of giant magnetoresistance and the prediction of spin-transfer torque are discussed, along with the plethora of new experimental techniques developed to make measurements on shorter length and time scales. Particular consideration is given to time-resolved measurements of the magneto-optical Kerr effect, and it is shown how a succession of studies performed with this technique has led to an improved understanding of the dynamics of nanoscale magnets. The dynamics can be surprisingly rich and complicated, with the latest studies of individual nanoscale elements showing that the dependence of the resonant mode spectrum upon the physical structure is still not well understood. Finally, the article surveys the prospects for development of high-frequency spintronic devices and highlights areas in which further study of fundamental properties will be required within the coming decade.}

The dynamical magnetoelectric effect, which is an inherent attribute of the spin excitations in multiferroics, drastically changes the optical properties of these compounds compared with conventional materials where light-matter interaction is expressed only by the dielectric permittivity or magnetic permeability. Here we show via polarized terahertz spectroscopy studies on multiferroic Ca2CoSi2O7, Sr2CoSi2O7 and Ba2CoGe2O7 that such magnetoeletric spin excitations exhibit quadrochroism, that is, they have different colours for all the four combinations of the two propagation directions (forward or backward) and the two orthogonal polarizations of a light beam. We demonstrate that one-way transparency can be realized for spin-wave excitations with sufficiently strong optical magnetoelectric effect. Furthermore, the transparent and absorbing directions of light propagation can be reversed by external magnetic fields. This magnetically controlled optical-diode function of magnetoelectric multiferroics may open a new horizon in photonics.}

  abstract = {Current needs for further advances in the nanotechnologies of information-storage and -processing devices have attracted a great deal of interest in spin (magnetization) dynamics in nanometre-scale patterned magnetic elements. For instance, the unique dynamic characteristics of non-uniform magnetic microstructures such as various types of domain walls, magnetic vortices and antivortices, as well as spin wave dynamics in laterally restricted thin-film geometries, have been at the centre of extensive and intensive researches. Understanding the fundamentals of their unique spin structure as well as their robust and novel dynamic properties allows us to implement new functionalities into existing or future devices. Although experimental tools and theoretical approaches are effective means of understanding the fundamentals of spin dynamics and of gaining new insights into them, the limitations of those same tools and approaches have left gaps of unresolved questions in the pertinent physics. As an alternative, however, micromagnetic modelling and numerical simulation has recently emerged as a powerful tool for the study of a variety of phenomena related to spin dynamics of nanometre-scale magnetic elements. In this review paper, I summarize the recent results of simulations of the excitation and propagation and other novel wave characteristics of spin waves, highlighting how the micromagnetic computer simulation approach contributes to an understanding of spin dynamics of nanomagnetism and considering some of the merits of numerical simulation studies. Many examples of micromagnetic modelling for numerical calculations, employing various dimensions and shapes of patterned magnetic elements, are given. The current limitations of continuum micromagnetic modelling and of simulations based on the Landau\cyrchar\cyrv\cyrchar\CYRDJE ``Lifshitz\cyrchar\cyrv\cyrchar\CYRDJE ``Gilbert equation of motion of magnetization are also discussed, along with further research directions for spin-wave studies.}

The spin polarization in the Cu wire increases exponentially with reducing the junction area irrespective of the same spacing between the injector and the detector. The junction size dependence of the spin signal yields the spin diffusion lengths and the spin polarization which are reasonable values compared with previous experiments.},

Recently, these magnetic textures have been directly observed in nanolayers of cubic helimagnets and monolayers of magnetic metals. We develop a micromagnetic theory of chiral skyrmions in thin magnetic layers for magnetic materials with intrinsic and induced chirality. Such particle-like and stable micromagnetic objects can exist in broad ranges of applied magnetic fields including zero field. Chiral skyrmions can be used as a new type of highly mobile nanoscale data carriers.}

The spin structures of head-to-head domain walls are systematically determined by direct imaging and magnetotransport, and quantitative domain wall type phase diagrams are obtained and compared with available theoretical predictions and micromagnetic simulations. Discrepancies to the experiment are explained by taking into account thermal excitations, and thermally-induced domain wall type transformations are observed. The coupling between domain walls via the stray field leads to changes in the wall spin structure and the stray field intensity from a wall is found to decrease as 1/ r with distance. Using the measured stray field values, the energy barrier height distribution for the nucleation of a vortex core is obtained. The pinning behaviour of domain walls at geometrical variations is discussed in detail and direct quantitative measurements of the width and depth of attractive potential wells responsible for the pinning are given. Dynamic measurements of resonant wall oscillations yield the exact shape of the potential well. Finally the domain wall propagation due to field and current is briefly discussed.}

We consider first the patterning and deposition techniques, which are used to fabricate ring structures (diameters between 0.1 and 2 um) and discuss their respective advantages and disadvantages. The results of direct nanoscale imaging of the novel magnetization configurations present in rings with different geometrical parameters (including discs) are discussed. These results give valuable insight into the influence of the magnetic anisotropies governing the magnetic states. The different types of domain walls that arise are compared quantitatively to micromagnetic simulations. The magnetodynamic switching between the different magnetic states is described in detail. In particular we elaborate on the different geometry-dependent magnetic switchings, since the different transitions occurring allow us to determine which energy terms govern the reversal process. We discuss a process by which fast (sub-ns) and controlled switching can be achieved, therefore making rings an attractive geometry for applications, in addition to studying fundamental issues of nanomagnetism.}

We employ the Landau-Lifshitz equation with a Slonczewski spin-torque term with in-plane polarization. We establish that the vortex dipole is set in steady-state rotational motion. The frequency of rotation is due to two independent forces: the interaction between the two vortices and an external in-plane magnetic field. The nonzero skyrmion number of the dipole is responsible for both forces giving rise to rotational dynamics. The spin torque acts to stabilize the rotational motion. We give analytical and numerical results for the frequency of rotation and VA dipole features as functions of the parameters.}

In the case that the vortex and the antivortex have opposite polarities the pair has a nonzero topological charge, and it behaves as a rotating vortex dipole. We find theoretically, and confirm numerically, the form of the energy as a function of the angular momentum of the system and the associated rotation frequencies. We discuss the process of annihilation of the pair which changes the topological charge of the system by unity while its energy is monotonically decreasing. Such a change in the topological charge affects profoundly the dynamics in the magnetic system. We finally discuss the connection of our results with Bloch Points (BP) and the implications for BP dynamics.}

We offer a resolution of this nontrivial dynamical behavior by examining the Hamiltonian structure of the model, specifically the linear momentum of the two solitons. We further investigate the dynamics of vortices in a modified nonlinear [sigma]-model which arises in the description of antiferromagnets. We confirm numerically that a robust feature of the dynamics is the right-angle scattering of two vortices which collide head-on. A generalization of our theory is given for this model which offers arguments towards an understanding of the observed dynamical behavior.}

In particular, we derive unambiguous expressions for the linear and angular momentum in a ferromagnetic film which are then used to study the dynamics of magnetic bubbles under the influence of an applied magnetic-field gradient. The semi-empirical golden rule of bubble dynamics is verified in its gross features but not in its finer details. A byproduct of our analysis is a set of virial theorems generalizing Derrick's scaling relation as well as a detailed recalculation of the fundamental magnetic bubble.}

We further calculate the vortex state and verify numerically that it satisfies the virial relation. The vortex profile has a simple form in the limit of a very thin particle where also the virial relation simplifies and effectively gives the vortex core radius. Away from the very thin limit, the vortex configuration becomes more complicated with a varying vortex core radius along the thickness of the particle.}

  abstract = {The magnetic properties of ferromagnetic thin films down to the nanoscale are ruled by the exchange stiffness, anisotropies and the effects of magnetic fields. As surfaces break inversion symmetry, an additional effective chiral exchange is omnipresent in any magnetic nanostructure. These so-called Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) affect all inhomogeneous magnetic states either subtly or spectacularly. E.g., DMIs cause a chirality selection of the rotation sense and can fix the local rotation axis for the magnetization in domain walls (DW). But, they can stabilize also entirely different twisted magnetic structures. The chiral skyrmions a two-dimensional particle-like topological soliton is the ultimately smallest of these objects, which currently is targetted as a possible information carrier in novel spintronic devices. Observation and quantification of the chiral exchange effects provide for the salient point in understanding magnetic properties in ultrathin films and other nanostructures. An easy and reliable method to determine the DMI constant as materials parameter of asymmetric thin films is the crucial problem. Here, we put forth an experimental approach for the determination of the complete set of the micromagnetic parameters. Quasi-static Kerr microcopy observations of DW creep motion and equilibrium sizes of circular magnetic objects in combination with standard magnetometry are used to derive a consistent set of these materials parameters in polycrystalline ultrathin film systems, namely CrOx/Co/Pt stacks. The quantified micromagnetic model for these films identifies the circular magnetic objects, as seen by the optical microscopy, as ordinary bubble domains with homochiral walls. From micromagnetic calculations, the chiral skyrmions stabilized by the DMI in these films are shown to have diameters in the range 40-200nm, too small to be observed by optical microscopy.},

Our method is based on the propagating-wave dynamic-matrix approach by Henry et al. (Ref. 19) and extends it to arbitrary cross sections using a finite-element method. We solve the linearized equation of motion of the magnetization only in a single waveguide cross section, which drastically reduces computational effort compared to common three-dimensional micromagnetic simulations. In order to numerically obtain the dipolar potential of individual spin-wave modes, we present a plane-wave version of the hybrid finite-element/boundary-element method by Fredkin and Koehler which we extend to a modified version of the Poisson equation. Our method is applied to several important examples of magnonic waveguides including systems with surface curvature, such as magnetic nanotubes, where the curvature leads to an asymmetric spin-wave dispersion. In all cases, the validity of our approach is confirmed by other methods. Our method is of particular interest for the study of curvature-induced or magnetochiral effects on spin-wave transport and also serves as an efficient tool to investigate standard magnonic problems.},

We find that lowering the rotational symmetry of nanotubes by decreasing the number of planar facets, splits an increasing number of spin-wave modes, which are doubly degenerate in cylindrical tubes. This symmetry-governed splitting is distinct form the topological one recently observed in cylindrical nanotubes. Doublet modes with half-integer or integer multiple azimuthal periods of the number of facets, split to singlet pairs with lateral standing-wave profiles of opposing mirror-plane symmetries. Furthermore, the polygonal geometry facilitates the hybridization of modes with different azimuthal periods but the same symmetry, manifested in avoided level crossings. These phenomena, unimaginable in cylindrical geometry, provide new tools to control spin dynamics on nanoscale. The presented concept can be generalized to nano-objects of versatile geometries and order parameters, offering new routes to engineer dynamic response in nanoscale devices.},

The experiments show that stimulation is possible over an extended range of excitation powers and a wide range of frequencies around the eigenfrequencies of the secondary modes. Rate-equation calculations predict an instantaneous response to stimulation and the possibility to prematurely trigger three-magnon splitting even above threshold in a sustainable manner. These predictions are confirmed experimentally using time-resolved Brillouin-light-scattering measurements and are in a good qualitative agreement with the theoretical results. We believe that the controllable mechanism of stimulated three-magnon splitting could provide a possibility to utilize magnon-based nonlinear networks as hardware for reservoir or neuromorphic computing.},

  year = {2019},
  abstract = {One of the fascinating qualities of spin waves (or magnons), which are the elementary excitations in magnetically ordered substances, is their nonlinear behavior at moder- ate excitation powers. This makes spin waves not only an attractive model system to study general nonlinear systems, but it also provides a way to utilize nonlinear dynamics in possible technical applications. In a ferromagnetic nano disk which is magnetized in the vortex state, the spin-wave modes meet strict boundary conditions and therefore inherit a discrete spectrum. When driven with a large enough excitation field, they can decay into other spin-wave modes within well-defined channels due to a nonlinear process called three-magnon scattering. The aim of this thesis is to explore this phenomenon within nonlinear spin-wave theory and by means of micromagnetic simulations. For this purpose, first the linear dynamics are mapped out and the possible scattering channels are predicted. The stability of these channels with respect to static external fields is studied. Within this context, exotic spin-wave modes which arise in a broken cylindrical symmetry are found. Moreover, a model to predict the temporal evolution of the spin-wave modes is developed within the classical Hamil- tonian formalism for nonlinear spin-wave dynamics. Together with micromagnetic simulations, this model is then applied in order to study the power-dependence of three-magnon scattering as well as to uncover a phenomenon called stimulated three-magnon scattering, which may allow for an integration of this nonlinear pro- cess in magnonics circuits. The results are compared with Brillouin light-scattering experiments which were conducted prior to this thesis or were motivated by it.},

By means of direct numerical solution of the corresponding eigenvalue problem and finite element micromagnetic simulations we demonstrate, that the curvature can induce localized modes with higher azimuthal and radial quantum numbers, which are absent for planar skyrmions (for the same parameters). The eigenfrequencies of all modes, except the breathing and gyromodes decreases with increasing curvature. Due to the translational symmetry break, the zero translational mode of the skyrmion gains a finite frequency and forms the gyromode, which describes the uniform rotation of skyrmions around the equilibrium position. In order to treat the gyromotion analytically we developed a Thiele-like collective variable approach. We show that N\textbackslash '\{e\}el skyrmions in curvilinear films experience a driving force originating from the gradient of the mean curvature. The gyrofrequency of the pinned skyrmion is proportional to the second derivative of the mean curvature at the point of equilibrium.},

The possibility of a phase transition characterized by a change in the response of the system to an external perturbation is discussed in the context of a mean field type of approximation. The critical behaviour found in this model displays very weak singularities. The application of these ideas to the xy model of magnetism, the solid-liquid transition, and the neutral superfluid are discussed. This type of phase transition cannot occur in a superconductor nor in a Heisenberg ferromagnet.}

  abstract = {In this work, we derive the interface exchange boundary conditions for the classical linear dynamics of magnetization in ferromagnetic layers with the interface Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (IDMI). We show that IDMI leads to pinning of dynamic magnetization at the interface. An unusual peculiarity of the IDMI-based pinning is that its scales as the spin-wave wave number. We incorporate these boundary conditions into an existing numerical model for the dynamics of the Damon-Eshbach spin wave in ferromagnetic films. IDMI affects the dispersion and the frequency non-reciprocity of the travelling Damon-Eshbach spin wave. For a broad range of film thicknesses L and wave numbers, the results of the numerical simulations of the spin wave dispersion are in a good agreement with a simple analytical expression, which shows that the contribution of IDMI to the dispersion scales as 1/L, similarly to the effect of other types of interfacial anisotropy. Suggestions to experimentalists how to detect the presence of IDMI in a spin wave experiment are given. \textcopyright{} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

  abstract = {Recently, the phase-field method has been extended and utilized across many fields of materials science. Since this method can incorporate, systematically, the effect of the coherency induced by lattice mismatch and the applied stress as well as the external electrical and magnetic fields, it has been applied to many material processes including solidification, solid-state phase transformations and various types of complex microstructure changes. In this paper, we focus on the recent phase-field simulations of real magnetic materials, and the simulation method for magnetic materials is explained comprehensively. Several applications of the phase-field method to clarifying the microstructure changes in magnetic materials, such as Ni 2 MnGa ferromagnetic shape memory alloy, FePt nanogranular thin film, Co\cyrchar\cyrv\cyrchar\CYRDJE ``Sm\cyrchar\cyrv\cyrchar\CYRDJE ``Cu rare-earth magnet, Fe\cyrchar\cyrv\cyrchar\CYRDJE ``Cr\cyrchar\cyrv\cyrchar\CYRDJE ``Co spinodal magnet, and Fe\cyrchar\cyrv\cyrchar\CYRDJE ``C steel with external magnetic field, are demonstrated. Furthermore, the general concept of the effective strategy for controlling microstructure in magnetic materials is proposed.}

Depending on the geometrical and magnetic parameters of the nanoring, there exist different magnetisation configurations (magnetic phases): two phases with homogeneous magnetisation (easy-axis and easy-plane phases) and two inhomogeneous (planar vortex phase and out-of-plane one). The existence of a new intermediate out-of-plane vortex phase, where the inner magnetisation is not strongly parallel to the easy axis, is predicted. Possible transitions between different phases are analysed using the combination of analytical calculations and micromagnetic simulations.},

For a large enough defect amplitude a discrete set of equilibrium magnetization states appears forming a ladder of energy levels. Each equilibrium state has either zero or unit topological charge, i.e. topologically trivial and skyrmion multiplets generally appear. Transitions between the levels with the same topological charge are allowed and can be utilized to encode and switch a bit of information. There is a wide range of geometrical and material parameters, where the skyrmion level has the lowest energy. As a result, periodically arranged curvilinear defects generate a skyrmion lattice as the ground state.},

A new method based on influence of the spin-transfer torque is used. The method allows one to obtain the dip structure for immobile vortex which significantly improves studying accuracy in comparison with the case of moving vortex. Free out-of-plane vortices as well as in-plane vortices pinned on hole defects are considered. It is shown that the process of the dip formation is different for free and pinned vortices and direction of the dip does not directly depend on the vortex polarity.}

By working in the time domain, we determined the motion of the magnetic moment throughout the process of spin-transfer\textendash driven switching, and we measured turn-on times of steady-state precessional modes. Time-resolved studies of magnetic relaxation allow for the direct measurement of magnetic damping in a nanomagnet and prove that this damping can be controlled electrically using spin-polarized currents.}

The use of the Barna\'s\textendash Mills magnetization boundary conditions has enabled us to systematically trace the origin of the magnonic band gaps in the spin-wave spectrum of such systems. We find that the band gaps are a ubiquitous attribute of a weakened interlayer coupling and a finite interface anisotropy (pinning). The band gaps in such systems represent a legacy of the discrete spin-wave spectrum of the individual magnetic layers periodically stacked to form the magnonic crystal rather than resulting from Bragg scattering. At the same time, magnonic crystals with band gaps due to the Bragg scattering can be described by natural boundary conditions (i.e. those maintaining continuity of the magnetization direction across the whole sample). We generalize our conclusions to systems beyond thin-film magnonic crystals and propose magnonic crystals based on the ideas of graded-index magnonics and those formed by Fano resonances as a possible way to circumvent the discovered issues.}

  abstract = {The study of collective spin excitations in magnetically ordered materials (so-called spin waves and the associated quasi-particles\textemdash magnons) has a successful history of more than 60 years. Recently, it has re-emerged in a new aspect under the name of magnonics, although the exact definition of its scope is still a subject for debate. However, it is widely accepted that the recent renaissance of interest in spin waves has been driven by three major factors: the rapid advance of nanotechnology, the development of new experimental techniques for studying high-frequency magnetization dynamics and the promise of a new generation of functional magnetic field controlled devices in which spin waves (magnons) would be employed, in particular to carry and process information. Furthermore, the growing interest in man-made 'crystals', such as those already realized in photonics, electronics and plasmonics, has served as a further strong catalyst for the development of so-called magnonic crystals. Magnonics as a research field is currently gaining momentum, attracting more and more researchers from various sub-fields of magnetism, materials science, microwave engineering, and beyond. Hence, it is timely to define the state of the art of this exciting research field emerging at the interface between magnetism and nanoscience. The first magnonics conference, entitled 'Magnonics: From Fundamentals to Applications' was held in Dresden in August 2009, sponsored by the visitor programme of the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems (MPIPKS). The event was a great success, having achieved its main aim of forming a community of magnonics researchers. It brought together both experts who held worldwide leading positions in nanomagnetism and spin wave research, and younger researchers just entering the field. The research results presented ranged from fundamental magnonic properties to their application in information technologies. The main scientific result of the conference in the broader sense was the emergence of magnonics as a sister field in the family of functional nanomaterials that also includes electronics, photonics, phononics, plasmonics etc. The presentations helped to define the state of the art and to highlight perspectives of the field. The conference led to the idea of publishing this cluster of papers aimed at reviewing the history of and the recent progress in magnonics. The cluster begins with a contribution from Kruglyak et al who aim to define the general scope and concepts of magnonics as a research field [1]. Serga et al review the state of the art in studies of spin waves in yttrium iron garnet (YIG) samples, which\textemdash due to the exceptionally low magnetic losses\textemdash have been the most popular and extensively investigated so far [2]. Gubbiotti et al review their recent experiments in which the magnonic band gap spectrum was observed in planar metallic magnonic crystals with submicrometre periods [3]. Kim demonstrates how numerical simulations can be used to investigate a wide range of magnonic phenomena in truly magnetic nanostructures, which still remains a challenge for modern experiments [4]. Finally, Khitun et al discuss the prospects and challenges for the creation of magnonic logic devices [5]. As with any dynamic research field, the reviews are inevitably incomplete. Nonetheless, we hope that the cluster of papers will stimulate further progress in magnonics and will provide a useful starting point for researchers newly entering this challenging and exciting research field.

This specific force plays a significant role in the quantum dynamics of a single vortex, for example the determination of the bound state of the vortex trapped by a pinning force arising from the interaction of the vortex with an impurity.}

We find that a parallel coupling between magnetic domains coexists with a non-parallel coupling between magnetic domain walls (DWs) of each ferromagnetic layer. We attribute the non-parallel coupling of the two magnetic layers to local magnetic stray fields arising at DWs in the magnetically harder Co layer. In the magnetically softer FeNi layer, non-ordinary DWs, such as 270\cyrchar\CYRV\textdegree{} and 90\cyrchar\CYRV\textdegree{} DWs with overshoot of the magnetization either inwards or outwards relative to the turning direction of the Co magnetization, are identified. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that in the absence of magnetic anisotropy, both types of overshooting DWs are energetically equivalent. However, if a uniaxial in-plane anisotropy is present, the relative orientation of the DWs with respect to the anisotropy axis determines which of these DWs is energetically favorable.}

We investigated the properties of the magnetic structures generated by a DM interaction under the influence of anisotropy or magnetic dipole interaction, by performing Monte-Carlo simulated annealing. We constructed phase maps in external-field and anisotropy space to study the effect of anisotropy or dipole interaction on the phase boundaries between the magnetic structures. The simulation results show that the phase boundaries are sensitive to perpendicular anisotropy and that the skyrmion lattice region in phase space is extended under easy-plane anisotropy. The effect of the long-range dipole interaction was studied and was found to stabilize the skyrmion lattice phase and reduce the size of the magnetic structures.},

  abstract = {Two-dimensional wall structures in ferro/antiferromagnetically exchange-coupled bilayers are calculated by means of numerical micromagnetic simulations. Extended wall tails occurring in non-compensated structures are duly accounted for via the introduction of a variable meshing along one space direction. Constant charge finite volumes and the application of general boundary conditions in the presence of interlayer exchange coupling and/or surface anisotropy further characterize the computation scheme. Simulated wall structures in zero field are compared with various approximate analytical models and the ranges of validity of the latter are made explicit. Hard-axis field intrinsic magnetization and hysteresis properties are outlined, and a sketch of the wall structure phase diagram is proposed for given material parameters and a specific geometry.}

The magnetization curve of the reversible process obtained by applying the field along the hard axis of the elliptical dot is almost linear, as is the case in the single-domain ellipsoidal particle. Due to the occurrence of the non uniform reversal, the switching field is reduced significantly compared to that predicted by the Stoner-Wohlfarth model. The nucleation fields of elliptical dots are calculated as a function of ellipse's aspect ratio, and the function reveals a step-like behavior.},

In the present paper, the existence of point (isolated essential) singularities at the origin in the radial part of the spins is demonstrated by explicitly finding the equilibrium configurations for a Heisenberg ferromagnetic system with circular, spherical, planar and axial symmetries. While the energy density diverges at these points, it is shown that by excluding a small region around these singularities a finite total energy may be obtained. By comparing the above solutions with that of the linear one-dimensional case, it is explained how the singularity develops as the dimensionality increases.}

  abstract = {The non-uniform magnetostatic field produced by the equilibrium and non-equilibrium magnetic states of magnetic nanotubes has been investigated theoretically. We consider magnetic fields produced by actual equilibrium states and transverse and vortex domain walls confined within the nanostructure. Our calculations allow us to understand the importance of the magnetostatic field in nanomagnetism, which is frequently considered as a uniform field. Moreover, our results can be used as a basis for future research of other properties, such as the investigation of spin waves when domain walls are present, or the motion of a magnetic particle near a magnetic field.}

  abstract = {Spin-wave modes are studied under the gradual transition from a flat thin film to a 'full' (one-dimensional) magnonic crystal. For this purpose, the surface of a pre-patterned 36.8 nm thin permalloy film was sequentially ion milled resulting in magnonic hybrid structures, referred to as surface-modulated magnonic crystals, with increasing modulation depth. After each etching step, ferromagnetic resonance measurements were performed yielding the spin-wave resonance modes in backward-volume and Damon-Eshbach geometry. The spin-wave spectra of these hybrid systems reveal an even larger variety of spin-wave states compared to the 'full' magnonic crystal. The measurements are corroborated by quasi-analytical theory and micromagnetic simulations in order to study the changing spin-wave mode character employing spin-wave mode profiles. In backward-volume geometry, a gradual transition from the uniform mode in the film limit to a fundamental mode in the thin part of the magnonic crystal was observed. Equivalently, the first and the second film modes are transform into a center and an edge mode of the thick part of the magnonic crystal. Simple transition rules from the \$n\^\textbackslash mathrmth\$ film mode to the \$m\^\textbackslash mathrmth\$ mode in the 'full' magnonic crystal are formulated unraveling the complex mode structure particularly in the backward-volume geometry. An analogous analysis was performed in the Damon-Eshbach geometry.},

The paper follows this path of the magnetic nanostructure, and explains some of the steps along the way: What are the technologies that employ magnetic nanostructures? How are these nanostructures made? What is the physics behind the functional parts? How are the magnetic properties measured? Finally, we present, in our view, a list of challenges hindering progress in these technologies.}

  abstract = {Micromagnetic simulations are performed to study the magnetic and electromagnetic properties of a ferromagnetic tube. Hysteresis loops and possible equilibrium states are observed with external field applied perpendicular and parallel to the tube axis. We found an equilibrium state, which is composed of two oppositely directed vortices, with a domain wall between them. The anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) was estimated at every point of the hysteresis loops, in order to investigate its potentiality as an electric device in nano/micro device. As a result, we found that our system can be used as a magnetic sensor that behaves differently according to the magnetic field direction.},

Such configurations, given the name Q-lumps, carry an integer-valued topological charge in addition to the conserved Noether charge. For a special choice of potential, they may be constructed explicitly in terms of simple functions via a natural extension of the usual Bogomolny equations. The existence of a Bogomolny bound guarantees that Q-lumps minimize the energy for any given value of Q. Their stability is discussed in detail and their interactions are investigated for low impact velocities using an adiabatic approximation. Forces transverse to the direction of motion lead to many possibilities, including circular orbits. Even head-on collisions have exotic scattering angles.}

This function originates from the diameter-dependent frequency of precession of the 3D vortex core about the direction of an applied static field . The characteristic angular frequency was found to be expressed as \$\o mega\_3DV={$<$}m\_\textbackslash hatr{$>\_$}V\textbackslash gammaH\_DC\$, where \${$<$}m\_\textbackslash hatr{$>\_$}V\$ is the average magnetization component of the ground-state vortex structure in the core direction, and {$\gamma$} is the gyromagnetic ratio. Numerical calculations also revealed that \${$<$}m\_\textbackslash hatr{$>\_$}V\$ is a strong function of 2R for a given material, as \${$<$}m\_\textbackslash hatr{$>\_$}V=(73.6\textbackslash pm3.4)(l\_ex/2R)\^2.2\$ with the exchange length lex. Our results provide not only a new physical insight into 3D vortex dynamics but also their potential applications to size-selective resonant excitation and/or possible detection of magnetic nano-particles.}

Despite recent progress, ferromagnetic order generates dipolar fields that prevent ultrasmall skyrmion sizes, and allows a transverse deflection of moving skyrmions that hinders their efficient manipulation. Antiferromagnetic skyrmions shall lift these limitations. Here we demonstrate that room-temperature antiferromagnetic skyrmions can be stabilized in synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs), in which perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, antiferromagnetic coupling and chiral order can be adjusted concurrently. Utilizing interlayer electronic coupling to an adjacent bias layer, we demonstrate that spin-spiral states obtained in a SAF with vanishing perpendicular magnetic anisotropy can be turned into isolated antiferromagnetic skyrmions. We also provide model-based estimates of skyrmion size and stability, showing that room-temperature antiferromagnetic skyrmions below 10 nm in radius can be anticipated in further optimized SAFs. Antiferromagnetic skyrmions in SAFs may thus solve major issues associated with ferromagnetic skyrmions for low-power spintronic devices.},

  abstract = {The magnetization dynamics of individual Fe-filled multiwall carbon-nanotubes (FeCNT), grown by chemical vapor deposition, are investigated by microresonator ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) and Brillouin light scattering (BLS) microscopy and corroborated by micromagnetic simulations. Currently, only static magnetometry measurements are available. They suggest that the FeCNTs consist of a single-crystalline Fe nanowire throughout the length. The number and structure of the FMR lines and the abrupt decay of the spin-wave transport seen in BLS indicate, however, that the Fe filling is not a single straight piece along the length. Therefore, a stepwise cutting procedure is applied in order to investigate the evolution of the ferromagnetic resonance lines as a function of the nanowire length. The results show that the FeCNT is indeed not homogeneous along the full length but is built from 300 to 400 nm long single-crystalline segments. These segments consist of magnetically high quality Fe nanowires with almost the bulk values of Fe and with a similar small damping in relation to thin films, promoting FeCNTs as appealing candidates for spin-wave transport in magnonic applications.},

  abstract = {An efficient method for computing thermodynamic equilibrium states at the micromagnetic length scale is introduced using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. Trial moves include not only rotations of vectors, but also a change in their magnetization length. The method is parameterized using the longitudinal susceptibility, reproduces the same Maxwell\textendash Boltzmann distribution as the stochastic Landau\textendash Lifshitz\textendash Bloch equation, and is applicable both below and above the Curie temperature. The algorithm is fully parallel, can be executed on graphical processing units, and efficiently includes the long-range dipolar interaction. This method is generally useful for computing finitetemperature relaxation states for both uniform and non-uniform temperature profiles and can be considered as complementary to zero-temperature micromagnetic energy minimization solvers, with comparable computation time. Compared to the dynamic approach, it is shown that the micromagnetic Monte Carlo method is up to almost 20 times faster. Moreover, unlike quasizero temperature approaches that do not take into account the magnetization length distribution and stochasticity, the method is better suited for structures with unbroken symmetry around the applied field axis, granular films, and at higher temperatures and fields. In particular, applications to finite-temperature hysteresis loop modelling, chiral magnetic thin films, granular magnetic media, and artificial spin ices are discussed.},

Our goal is to illustrate the advantages and difficulties encountered when deploying GPU technology to perform sparse linear algebra computations. Techniques for speeding up sparse matrix-vector product (SpMV) kernels and finding suitable preconditioning methods are discussed. Our experiments with an NVIDIA TESLA M2070 show that for unstructured matrices SpMV kernels can be up to 8 times faster on the GPU than the Intel MKL on the host Intel Xeon X5675 Processor. Overall performance of the GPU-accelerated Incomplete Cholesky (IC) factorization preconditioned CG method can outperform its CPU counterpart by a smaller factor, up to 3, and GPU-accelerated The incomplete LU (ILU) factorization preconditioned GMRES method can achieve a speed-up nearing 4. However, with better suited preconditioning techniques for GPUs, this performance can be further improved.},

Also, the amplitude and phase of the harmonic response is deduced for a nonsymmetric thin film head. 2) The computed harmonic response of a shielded magnetoresistive head demonstrates that there is no true gap null (i.e., the response never goes through a zero) even if the head is symmetrically disposed between the shields. 3) The flux pattern of a conventional inductive head is mapped. It is shown that the output of a flux sensing loop just above the surface of the head can be used as a measure of head efficiency provided loop dimensions are small enough. \textcopyright{} 1981 IEEE},

  abstract = {We investigate the quantum mechanical energy levels of an electron constrained to motion on a nanoscale M\"obius ring by solving the Schr\"odinger equation on the curved surface. The dimensions of the ring in terms of the lateral and transverse parameters u,v for the M\"obius ring allow us to identify the quantum numbers for the levels by (n u,n v). We show that the energy levels can still be labeled using the quantum numbers of the cylindrical ring of the same dimensions. While the Hamiltonian has invariance under parity in parameter space, the rotational symmetry about any axis in configuration space is lost, so that the double degeneracy of energy levels for azimuthal quantum number n u1, that exists in cylindrical rings, is lifted by a small amount in the M\"obius ring. The pattern of level splitting has been identified in terms of the number of twists {$\sigma$} to be 2n u=s{$\sigma$} where s is an integer. The scaling properties of the energy levels with respect to the dimensions of the ring are derived; using these properties, our numerical results which are given for a specific geometry can be extended to rings of other commensurate dimensions. The absence of rotational invariance for the M\"obius ring manifests itself through the orbital angular momentum L z not commuting with the Hamiltonian. Its expectation values are found to have nearly integral as well as half-integral values of, and its variances are small. The energy levels with half-integral azimuthal quantum numbers (n u) are also close to the approximate formula for the equivalent cylindrical ring, provided such half-integral quantum numbers are allowed for the cylindrical geometry. The Zeeman splitting of the energy levels in an external magnetic field is displayed, together with wave functions at a level anticrossing. The optical transitions between electronic states on the M\"obius ring are obtained, and a table of oscillator strengths is provided. The results for energy levels for rings with multiple twists are presented. In view of recent technological advances in the production of graphene sheets, we may anticipate the making of such twisted rings with graphene strips of finite width. Graphene strips of finite width have an open band gap at the K points in the Brillouin zone, so that a nonrelativistic treatment with a small effective mass is appropriate. For M\"obius rings of graphene, our results would be directly relevant, and we may anticipate their experimental verification in the near future. \textcopyright{} 2012 American Physical Society.},

Besides vortex core gyrotropic motion, polarity switching, chirality switching, and polarity plus chirality switching, we also observe non-switching and partial switching behaviors in some cases. Investigations of these switching behaviors find that polarity is switched by nucleation and annihilation of the vortex\cyrchar\cyrv\cyrchar\CYRDJE ``antivortex pair for the polarity-switching only regime, and chirality reversal is realized by moving, nucleation, and annihilation of vortices in the disk for lower current density, but by propagating of spin waves for higher current density. Moreover, the reversal of chirality is always accompanied by polarity switching, and the accompanied polarity switching for the higher current density case is realized by the expansion and compression of the vortex core, not the traditional vortex\cyrchar\cyrv\cyrchar\CYRDJE ``antivortex pair-mediated mechanism.},

  abstract = {In an earlier experiment, we have used the BTi twin MAGNES system (2 x 37 channels) to record the evoked magnetic field from five healthy right-handed male volunteers using two tasks: visual recognition of complex objects including faces and facial expressions of emotion. We have repeated the experiment with one of the five subjects using the BTi whole head system (148 channels). Magnetic field tomography (MFT) was used to extract 3D estimates of brain activity millisecond by millisecond from the recorded magnetoencephalographic (MEG) signals. Results from the MFT analysis of the average signals of the five subjects have been reported elsewhere (Streit et al. 1997; Streit et al. 1999). In this paper, we present results of the detailed single trial analysis for the subject recorded from the whole head system. We found activations in areas extending from the occipital pole to anterior areas. Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined entirely on functional criteria and confirmed independently by the location of the maximum activity on the MRI. Activation curves for each ROI were computed and objective statistical measures (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) were then used to identify time segments for which the ROI activity showed significant differences both within the same and across different object/emotion categories. Emphasis is placed on the quantification of the activity from two ROIs, fusiform gyrus (FG) and amygdala (AM), which have been best studied in the context of processing of faces and facial expressions of emotion, respectively. We found no face-specific area as such, but instead areas like the FG was activated by all complex objects at roughly similar latencies and varying strengths. The amygdala activity was significantly different between 150 and 180 ms for fearful expression, and even earlier for happy expression. FAU - Liu, L}

Based on a theoretical model and micromagnetic simulations, we show that either cubic or uniaxial magneto-crystalline anisotropies have some influence on the domain wall properties (wall size, propagation velocity and energy barrier) and then on the overall magnetization reversal mechanism. Besides the characterization of the transverse and vortex domain wall sizes for different anisotropies, we predict an anisotropy dependent transition between the occurrence of transverse and vortex domain walls in tubular nanowires. We also discuss the dynamics of the vortex DW propagation gradually increasing the uniaxial anisotropy constant and we found that the average velocity is considerably reduced. Our results show that different anisotropies can be considered in real samples in order to manipulate the domain wall behavior and the magnetization reversal process.},

  abstract = {Wave turbulence is a state far from (thermodynamic) equilibrium. It can be observed in a stormy sea, a hot plasma, a dielectric in a powerful laser beam, in magnets exposed to strong microwave fields, etc. A distinction has to be made between fully developed turbulence and parametric turbulence. The latter is the subject of the present book. Addressing not only the expert but also the graduate student it gives a comprehensive review covering developments both in the West and in Eastern Europe where major research into this field has been done. Special attention is paid to the Hamiltonian formalism, multi-wave processes, modulation instabilities, self-focusing, wave collapses, S-theory, the mean-field approximation, chaos, Feynman diagrams, and comparison with experiments (magnons, spin waves). 1 Introduction to Nonlinear Wave Dynamics \textendash{} 1.1 Hamiltonian Method for Description of Waves in a Continuous Medium \textendash{} 1.2 Dimensional Estimation of Hamiltonian Coefficients \textendash{} 1.3 Dynamic Equations of Motion for Weakly Non-Conservative Wave Systems \textendash{} 1.4 Three-Wave Processes \textendash{} 1.5 Four-Wave Processes \textendash{} 2 The General Properties of Magnetodielectrics \textendash{} 2.1 Classification of Substances by Their Magnetic Properties \textendash{} 2.2 Nature of Interaction of Magnetic Moments \textendash{} 2.3 Energy of Ferromagnets in the Continuum Approximation \textendash{} 2.4 Magnetic and Crystallographic Structure of Some Magnets \textendash{} 3 Spin Waves (Magnons) in Magnetically Ordered Dielectrics \textendash{} 3.1 Hamiltonian of Magnons in Ferromagnets (FM) \textendash{} 3.2 Hamiltonian Function of Magnons in Antiferromagnets \textendash{} 3.3 Comments at the Road Fork \textendash{} 3.4 Calculation of Magnon Hamiltonian \textendash{} 4 Nonlinear Dynamics of Narrow Packets of Spin Waves \textendash{} 4.1 Elementary Processes of Spin Wave Interaction \textendash{} 4.2 Self-Focusing of Magnetoelastic Waves in Antiferromagnets (AFM) \textendash{} 4.3 Methods of Parametric Excitation of Spin Waves \textendash{} 5 Stationary Nonlinear Behavior of Parametrically Excited Waves.

We review the experimental literature that provides partial evidence for these AFM spintronic effects but demonstrates that, like exchange-bias effects, they are sensitive to details of interface structure that are not always under experimental control. Finally, we speculate briefly on some strategies that might advance progress.}

We show further that the subset of those classes corresponding to elements of order 2 in this group has representatives that are planar and characterize the obstruction for other classes in terms of merons. The planar textures are a feature of the global defect topology that is not reflected in any local characterization. Finally, we describe how the global classification relates to recent experiments on nematic droplets and how elements of order 4 relate to the presence of {$\tau$} lines in cholesterics.}

The two-dimensional two-component model, with equal coherence lengths and no magnetic field, shows some interesting properties. In the absence of a Josephson type coupling between the two order parameters a "textured vortex" is found by analytical and numerical solution of the Ginzburg-Landau equations. With a Josephson type coupling between the two order parameters we find the system to split up in two domains separated by a domain wall, where the order parameter is depressed to zero.}

Two different dot configurations have been considered: a solid dot (disk) and a dot with a hole in the center (ring). The results show two different switching mechanisms depending on dot diameter and thickness: magnetization rotation for small dimensions and vortex nucleation for bigger dimensions, the threshold size being around 100 nm in diameter and 5 nm in thickness. The switching currents obtained for different dot diameters appear to be very similar. On the contrary the dependence on dot thickness is strong, the switching currents being smaller for thinner dots.},

Some general features associated with solitons-stationary states, bound states of solitons, stability, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam problem, and so on are discussed for both one- and more-dimensional worlds. The results of computer experiments on the dynamics of the formation and interaction (in one-space-dimensional geometry) of soliton-type objects are presented at length. As an application of the general theory we speculate on solitons in plasmas and particle physics. Finally, new, spherically symmetric, oscillating solutions ("pulsons") are examined in the framework of [phi]4 and sine-Gordon theories.}

In this review, we compare three methods of proof, study the conditions of the potential for the Levinson theorem and generalize it to the Dirac equation. The method with the Sturm\&ndash;Liouville theorem is explained in some detail. References to development and application of the Levinson theorem are introduced.}

  abstract = {Spin-orbit coupling in inversion-asymmetric magnetic crystals and structures has emerged as a powerful tool to generate complex magnetic textures, interconvert charge and spin under applied current, and control magnetization dynamics. Current-induced spin-orbit torques mediate the transfer of angular momentum from the lattice to the spin system, leading to sustained magnetic oscillations or switching of ferromagnetic as well as antiferromagnetic structures. The manipulation of magnetic order, domain walls and skyrmions by spin-orbit torques provides evidence of the microscopic interactions between charge and spin in a variety of materials and opens novel strategies to design spintronic devices with potentially high impact in data storage, nonvolatile logic, and magnonic applications. This paper reviews recent progress in the field of spin-orbitronics, focusing on theoretical models, material properties, and experimental results obtained on bulk noncentrosymmetric conductors and multilayer heterostructures, including metals, semiconductors, and topological insulator systems. Relevant aspects for improving the understanding and optimizing the efficiency of nonequilibrium spin-orbit phenomena in future nanoscale devices are also discussed.},

In analogy with fluid vortices it is possible to express the linear and angular momenta as low moments of vorticity. The conservation laws are shown to be consistent with those obtained in the moduli space approximation for vortex dynamics, valid close to the Bogomol'nyi limit. For Bogomol'nyi vortices, the relevant moments of vorticity can be evaluated fairly explicitly, as can the integral of log|phi|2, where phi is the scalar field. Conservation of angular momentum prevents a single vortex from escaping to infinity.}

Examples are monopoles and Skyrmions, Ginzburg-Landau vortices and sigma-model lumps, and Yang-Mills instantons. This book is a comprehensive survey of static topological solitons and their dynamical interactions. Particular emphasis is placed on the solitons which satisfy first-order Bogomolny equations. For these, the soliton dynamics can be investigated by finding the geodesics on the moduli space of static multi-soliton solutions. Remarkable scattering processes can be understood this way. The book starts with an introduction to classical field theory, and a survey of several mathematical techniques useful for understanding many types of topological soliton. Subsequent chapters explore key examples of solitons in one, two, three and four dimensions. The final chapter discusses the unstable sphaleron solutions which exist in several field theories.}

When the spatial direction of the polarisation changes, in a domain structure, the electrons must somehow accommodate the necessary change in direction of their spin angular momentum as they pass through the wall. Reflection, scattering, or a transfer of angular momentum onto the lattice are all possible outcomes, depending on the circumstances. This gives rise to a variety of different physical effects, most importantly a contribution to the electrical resistance caused by the wall, and a motion of the wall driven by the spin-polarised current. Historical and recent research on these topics is reviewed.}

Vortex-mediated magnetization reversal in individual ultra-small ({$\sim$} 100 nm) ferromagnetic particles at low temperatures is studied by nanoSQUID magnetometry. At zero applied bias field, the flux-closure magnetic state (vortex) and the quasi uniform configuration are bi-stable. This stems from the extremely small size of the nanoparticles that lies very close to the limit of single-domain formation. The analysis of the temperature-dependent (from 0.3 to 70 K) hysteresis of the magnetization allows us to infer the nature of the ground state magnetization configuration. The latter corresponds to a vortex state as also confirmed by electron holography experiments. Based on the simultaneous analysis of the vortex nucleation and annihilation data, we estimate the magnitude of the energy barriers separating the quasi single-domain and the vortex state and their field dependence. For this purpose, we use a modified power-law scaling of the energy barriers as a function of the applied bias field. These studies are essential to test the thermal and temporal stability of flux-closure states stabilized in ultra-small ferromagnets.},

  doi = {10.1007/bfb0090903},
  abstract = {The performance of preconditioned conjugate gradient methods for the solution of a linear system of equations Hx = b depends strongly on the quality of the preconditioner. In many applications the system of equations to be solved originates from a partial differential equation discretized by the choice of an initial mesh geometry, a meshrefinement technique and a type of finite element basisfunctions. In general the resulting matrix is a sparse matrix which sparsity pattern only depends on the discretization choices. For the construction of a preconditioner only the matrix entries are needed, but investigations so far clearly have shown that taking into account additionally the discretization choices via the sparsity pattern leads to more effective preconditioning techniques, of which many exist. Relatively simple techniques like ILU and SSOR take the matrix entries into account but disregard the sparsity pattern. Somewhat more effective techniques like Block-Incomplete ones make use of the sparsity patterns regularity resulting from a regular mesh geometry. In addition multi-grid techniques take into account that a fine mesh geometry is obtained by the refinement of a coarse mesh. Intermediate 'levels' of refinement are distinguished and used explicitly. More flexible are algebraic multilevel preconditioners which assign a 'level' to each individual degree of freedom. As the sparsity pattern is of importance for the construction of good preconditioners it is analysed for the hierarchical matrix H resulting from a given discretization. The hierarchy is induced by the mesh refinement method applied. It is shown that the sparsity pattern is irregular but well structured in general and a simple refinement method is presented which enables a compact storage and quick retrieval of the matrix entries in the computers memory. An upperbound for the C.-B.-S. scalar for this method is determined to demonstrate that it is well suited for multi-level preconditioning and it is shown to have satisfying angle bounds. Further it turns out that the hierarchical matrix may be partially constructed in parallel, is block structured and shows block decay rates.},

Neglecting magnetocrystalline and magnetostrictive anisotropy energies, minimization of exchange and magnetostatic energy leads to one of two types of domain wall structures: `transverse' walls with magnetization at the center of the wall directed transverse to the strip axis and `vortex' walls where the magnetization forms a vortex at the center of the wall. Calculation of the domain wall energies leads to a proposed phase diagram for head to head domain walls where transverse walls have lower energy when dimensions are less than tcritwcrit 130 A/mu0Ms2.}

  abstract = {Chiral lagrangians as effective field theories of QCD are successfully applied to meson physics at low energies in the framework of chiral perturbation theory. Because of their nonlinear structure these lagrangians allow for static soliton solutions which may be interpreted as baryons. Their semiclassical quantization, which provides the leading order in an 1/NC expansion (NC is the number of colors) turned out to be insufficient in many cases to obtain good agreement with empirical baryon observables. However with NC = 3, large corrections are expected in the next-to-leading order which is carried by pionic fluctuations around the soliton background. The calculation of these corrections requires renormalization to one-loop of the underlying field theory. We present a procedure to calculate the one-loop contributions for a variety of baryonic observables. In contrast to chiral perturbation theory, terms with an arbitrary number of gradients may, in principle, contribute and the restriction to low chiral orders can only be justified by the investigation of the scale independence of the results. The results generally give the right sign and magnitude to reduce the discrepancy between theory and experiment with one exception: the axial quantities. These suffer from the fact that the underlying current algebra mixes different NC orders, which suggests a large and positive next-to-next-to-leading order contribution, which is probably sufficient to close the gap to experiment.},

The structure of such a wall can roughly be imagined as a sequence of magnetic vortices and anti-vortices, arranged along a straight line. In this work, equilibrium energies of different one-dimensional magnetic domain wall configurations, existing in thin soft ferromagnetic films, are calculated (fully taking into account the exchange and long range dipolar interaction), based on the various classical Ritz models. They are compared to the energy of two-dimensional cross-tie domain wall, thus, estimating the region of the film thicknesses, where the cross-tie structure is the lowest energy domain wall configuration. The upper boundary of this region is estimated here for the first time. Convenient approximate analytical energy expressions in terms of elementary functions are given here both for classical and for cross-tie domain walls.}

In cylinders with the radii less than the single-domain radius the vortex state is unstable and is absolutely prohibited (except if pinned by material imperfections), so that the distribution of the magnetization vector in such cylinders in no applied magnetic field is uniform (or quasi-uniform).

  abstract = {A simple approach allowing to construct closed-form analytical zero-field magnetization distributions in cylindrical particles of a small thickness and an arbitrary shape (not necessarily circular) is presented. The approach is based on reduction of the non-linear Euler equations for magnetization vector field to the classical linear Riemann-Hilbert problem. The result contains all the distributions minimizing the exchange energy functional and the surface magnetostatic contribution exactly, except for the neighbourhood of topological singularities on the cylinder faces where the result is approximate. The completeness of the analysis permitted to find a new type of a topological soliton in the case of circular cylinder. Also, an example of magnetic vortex in a triangular cylinder is given to investigate the role of the particle corners. 75.60.Ch, 75.70.Kw, 85.70.Kh Small magnetic particles shaped as flat arbitrary cylinders with the size of the order of 100 nanometers and their arrays recently captured a lot of attention due to their unusual magnetic properties (as unique systems where two-dimensional topological solitons can be directly observed) and also because of their applications in the magnetic random access memory devices. In large ferromagnetic bodies the equilibrium magne-tization distributions are usually represented as a set of magnetic domains separated by possibly bent one-dimensional domain walls [1]. Unfortunately, this approach is hard to apply to small magnetic particles if their size is such that the domain wall does not fit inside , resulting in considerable distortions of its profile with respect to the one-dimensional case. Consequently, it is necessary to consider this distribution as a whole. A number of finite-element simulations of the problem were already performed, see e.g. [2] and references therein. In this Letter an analytical approach allowing to find closed-form expressions for equilibrium topologically charged magnetization distributions in soft magnetic particles shaped as flat arbitrary cylinders is presented. Mathematical formulation of the problem. Consider a particle made of an isotropic magnetic material, the anisotropy of soft material is neglected here. In the case of no applied magnetic field its total energy has two contributions, the exchange and the dipolar (magneto-static). Let us limit ourselves to the cylindrical particles with thickness L {$<$} L E = C/M 2 S (it usually can be relaxed [3] for L up to several L E), where C is the exchange constant and M S is the saturation magnetization of the material. In this case the magnetization distribution m(r) = m X , m Y , m Z = M (r)/M S , | m(r)| = 1 can be assumed uniform along the cylinder thickness (Z axis), with r = X, Y the radius vector in the cylinder plane. In this notation the total energy of the particle (a functional of m) can be written in the following way e[ m] M 2 S = D      L 2 E L 2 i=X,Y,Z ({$\nabla$}m i) 2 - L/2 -L/2 h D [ m] {$\cdot$} m dz      d 2 r, (1) where D is the area of the cylinder face, {$\nabla$} = {$\partial$}/{$\partial$}X, {$\partial$}/{$\partial$}Y, {$\partial$}/{$\partial$}Z is the gradient operator, h D [ m] = H D [ m]/M S is the demagnetizing field (a functional of m) created by the magnetization distribution. The demag-netizing field can be expressed using the Maxwell equations through its scalar potential H D = {$\nabla$}U (r), which is, in turn, a solution of the Poisson equation {$\nabla$} 2 U = {$\rho$} with the requirement (due to the finite size of the particle) that both | r|U and | r| 2 |{$\nabla$}U | are finite as | r| \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$}, {$\rho$} = {$\nabla$} {$\cdot$} M is the density of magnetic charges (on the boundary equal to the normal component of M), [4]. The exact solution for equilibrium m(r) corresponds to the minimum of the functional (1) and is given by a system of non-linear integral partial differential equations. They are hard to handle even with the help of computer for a particular case. Thus, a simplification of the original problem (1) needs to be applied. To make such simplification let us qualitatively analyze contributions of the different energy terms in (1). It turns out that for sufficiently small particle there is a well defined hierarchy of energies. The most important term is the exchange, as when the particle gets smaller not only the amount of possible magnetic charges decreases (on par with the exchange energy) but also (due to absence of magnetic monopoles) the positive self energy of charges gets more and more compensated by their negative interaction energy. It is also clear, as the role of surface increases for small particle sizes, that the surface magnetostatic contribution is more important then the volume one. The surface contribution can be subdivided into the energy of the magnetic charges on the faces and on the side of the cylinder. Because for flat cylinders the faces have usually larger area than the side, the former energy is more important. Thus, in flat cylinders we have the following energy hierarchy: exchange, face charges, side charges, volume charges. Note that the exact criteria for the necessary smallness of the cylinder strongly depend on its shape (due to the long-range character of the dipolar interactions) and should be analyzed 1},

A survey of exact solutions to the nonlinear equations of motion for pertinent classical chain systems (sine-Gordon chain and ferromagnetic Heisenberg chains with various anisotropies) is given. Particular emphasis is devoted to the role of solitons in the thermodynamics of such systems. Models corresponding to real quasi-one-dimensional magnets are broadly discussed to demonstrate the properties of their solitary excitations. The experimental significance of such nonlinear excitations in the static and dynamic quantities of such systems is discussed in detail. The models and model substances are the easy-plane ferromagnet (model substances CsNiF\textsubscript{3} and (C\textsubscript{6}H\textsubscript{11}NH\textsubscript{3})CuBr\textsubscript{3}), the easy-plane antiferromagnet (CH\textsubscript{3})\textsubscript{4}NMnCl\textsubscript{3}) and the \emph{S} = \cyrchar\CYRV\cyrchar\CYRDZE{} Ising chain with transverse interactions (CsCoCl\textsubscript{3}). The quantum aspects of solitary excitations are treated in some theoretical detail. Finally, open questions and possible future investigations are discussed.}

  abstract = {The existence of backscattering-immune spin-wave modes is demonstrated in magnetic thin films of nanoscale thickness. Our results reveal that chiral magnetostatic surface waves (CMSSWs), which propagate perpendicular to the magnetization direction in an in-plane magnetized thin film, are robust against backscattering from surface defects. CMSSWs are protected against various types of surface inhomogeneities and defects as long as their frequency lies inside the gap of the volume modes. Our explanation is independent of the topology of the modes and predicts that this robustness is a consequence of symmetry breaking of the dynamic magnetic fields of CMSSWs due to the off-diagonal part of the dipolar interaction tensor, which is present both for long- (dipole-dominated) and short-wavelength (exchange-dominated) spin waves. Micromagnetic simulations confirm the robust character of the CMSSWs. Our results open a new direction in designing highly efficient magnonic logic elements and devices employing CMSSWs in nanoscale thin films.}

Our point of view is that it is desirable for the discrete problem to possess conservation properties similar to the continuous system. We first prove the existence of a new class of Liapunov functions for the continuous problem, and then for a variational formulation of the continuous problem. We also show a special continuous dependence result. Then we propose a family of mass-lumped finite element schemes for the problem. For the resulting semi-discrete problem we show that magnetization is conserved and that semi-discrete Liapunov functions exist. Finally we show the results of some computations that show the behavior of the fully discrete Liapunov functions.}

  abstract = {A magnetic skyrmion usually refers to a twisted spin texture in a uniformly aligned magnetization state. Such spin texture is protected by topology, which makes the skyrmion a stable texture under small perturbations. Thus, skyrmions have attracted great interest for possible applications as an ideal information carrier. Most magnetic skyrmion studies have focused on perpendicularly magnetized systems, where the skyrmion topological charge is determined by the relative orientation between the core and outer perpendicular magnetization directions. Thus, skyrmions with opposite signs of topological charges do not seem to coexist in the same magnetic domain. Here we show that there also exists a different type of magnetic skyrmion with surrounding spins that are uniformly aligned to the in-plane direction. A clear feature of this in-plane skyrmion is that skyrmions with opposite signs of topological charges can coexist with each other. Proper choice of magnetization and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction leads to a window for the existence of this in-plane skyrmion. These findings demonstrate the inherent possibility of a double-bit transfer in a single magnetic wire, which is not possible in a perpendicularly magnetized system.},

We address here the case of general non-symmetric dumbbell-shaped domains with a small constriction and general multi-well potentials. Our main results concern the existence and uniqueness of non-constant local minimizers, their full classification in the case of convex bulks, and the complete description of their asymptotic behavior, as the size of the constriction tends to zero.}

As for the case of field-induced domain wall propagation in thick films, two motion regimes with different mobilities are obtained, below and far above the so-called Walker field. Additionally, for the case of current induced motion, a Walker-like current density threshold is defined. The threshold field and current density, stating the wall's internal structure stability, differ from those in thick films; both are reduced by the same geometrical demagnetising factor which accounts for the confinement. This points out the fact that the velocity dependence over an extended field/current range and the knowledge of the Walker breakdown are mandatory to draw conclusions about the phenomenological Gilbert damping parameter tuning the magnetisation dynamics.}

  abstract = {Although microscopic laws of physics are invariant under the reversal of the arrow of time, the transport of energy and information in most devices is an irreversible process. It is this irreversibility that leads to intrinsic dissipations in electronic devices and limits the possibility of quantum computation. We theoretically predict that the electric field can induce a substantial amount of dissipationless quantum spin current at room temperature, in hole-doped semiconductors such as Si, Ge, and GaAs. On the basis of a generalization of the quantum Hall effect, the predicted effect leads to efficient spin injection without the need for metallic ferromagnets. Principles found here could enable quantum spintronic devices with integrated information processing and storage units, operating with low power consumption and performing reversible quantum computation.}

The theory treats the domain walls as one-dimensional objects with orientation-dependent energy, which interact with the sample edges. We show that under an applied field the domain wall remains straight, but tilts at an angle to the direction of the magnetic field that is proportional to the field strength for moderate fields and sufficiently strong DMI. Furthermore, we obtain a nonlinear dependence of the tilt angle on the applied field at weaker DMI. Our analytical results are corroborated by micromagnetic simulations.},

  abstract = {The stability of magnetic domain structures of small grains of magnetite were examined between room temperature and the Curie temperature using a high-resolution three-dimensional micromagnetic algorithm. At all times the minimum resolution used was determined by calculating the exchange length. Using an unconstrained model, the single domain (SD) to multidomain (MD) threshold grain size d 0 was found to be nearly independent of temperature up to \&\#8764;450\textdegree C. Above this temperature, d 0 was observed to rise sharply. Energy barriers between metastable domain states trapped in local energy minimums (LEM) were determined using a constrained algorithm. Three types of domain structure were considered: SD, vortex, and double vortex (effectively three domain), in a range of grain sizes with side length between 30 and 300 nm. In addition, the effect of varying shape was also considered by examining asymmetric grains with aspect ratios up to 1.4. From the numerical solutions energy barriers between LEM states were determined. It was found that MD grains 300 nm in size display higher stability than smaller SD grains (\&\#8764;50 nm). Double vortex states were found to be less stable than single vortex states at nearly all temperatures. Blocking temperatures as function of grain size for both symmetric and asymmetric grains were determined and agree well with experimental results. Transdomain thermoremanence analysis indicated that there are a limited number of grain sizes and shapes which will nucleate domain wall-type structures during cooling. Such nucleation events would cause the total measured remanence to decrease with cooling in conflict with N\cyrchar\cyrishrt el's analytical theory for remanence cooling behavior but in agreement with experimental observations.},

We show that the extrinsic curvature of the shell combined with the out-of-plane component of the director field gives rise to chirality effects. This interplay produces an effective energy term reminiscent of the chiral term in cholesteric liquid crystals, with the curvature tensor acting as a sort of anisotropic helicity. We discuss also how the different nature of the order parameter, a vector in ferromagnets and a tensor in nematics, yields different textures on surfaces with the same topology as the sphere. In particular, we show that the extrinsic curvature governs the ground state configuration on a nematic spherical shell, favouring two antipodal disclinations of charge \$+1\$ on small particles and four \$+1/2\$ disclinations of charge located at the vertices of a square inscribed in a great circle on larger particles.},

  abstract = {The solution of large sparse linear systems arises in many applications, such as computational fluid dynamics and oil reservoir simulation. In realistic cases the matrices are often so large that they require large scale distributed parallel computing to obtain the solution of interest in a reasonable time. In this paper we discuss the design and implementation of the AmgX library, which provides drop-in GPU acceleration of distributed algebraic multigrid (AMG) and preconditioned iterative methods. The AmgX library implements both classical and aggregation-based AMG methods with different selector and interpolation strategies, along with a variety of smoothers and preconditioners, including block-Jacobi, Gauss\textendash Seidel, and incomplete-LU factorization. The library contains many of the standard and flexible preconditioned Krylov subspace iterative methods, which can be combined with any of the available multigrid methods or simpler preconditioners. The parallelism in the aggregation scheme exploits parallel graph matching techniques, while the smoothers and preconditioners often rely on parallel graph coloring algorithms. The AMG algorithm implemented in the AmgX library achieves 2\textendash 5\texttimes{} speedup on a single GPU against a competitive implementation on the CPU. As will be shown in the numerical experiments section, both setup and solve phases scale well across multiple nodes, sustaining this performance advantage.},

  abstract = {Background: MicroRNAs are novel regulators of gene expression that are linked to the main oncogene networks, including the p53 pathway. p53 regulates the maturation process of miR-16 and miR-143. We analyzed the role as prognostic markers of miR-16 and miR-143 in 70 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Methods: MicroRNAs were analyzed by TaqMan MicroRNA assays. Disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were examined using Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank tests and the Cox proportional hazard model. Results: When patients were classified in three groups according to their miR-16 expression levels, those with normal levels had the best outcome while those with high levels had the worst. DFS was 22.4 months for patients with high levels, 71.8 months for those with normal levels, and 55.8 months for those with low levels (P = 0.05). OS was 23.9 months for patients with high levels, 97.6 months for those with normal levels, and 63.5 months for those with lowlevels (P {$<$} 0.001). In the multivariate analyses, high miR-16 levels emerged as an independent prognostic factor for poor DFS (P = 0.001) and OS ({$<$}0.001). Conclusions: Our results provide the first hints that miR-16 levels in tumor samples may be a prognostic marker in NSCLC. \textcopyright{} 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  abstract = {Micromagnetic studies of the reversal of stripe domains in elements of different geometries are reported. Various 2D and 3D codes are used in order to allow comparison between an infinite slab, nanowires and dots. Starting from a saturated state the establishment of stripe domains through the sample is first studied. Contrary to the thin film case, the nucleation of this pattern is not uniform and is very different to the geometry of a wire or an isolated dot. Special attention is paid to the reversal of the core of the vortex (the remnants of inner walls between up and down domains) which requires the insertion of point singularities called Bloch points (BP) either at surfaces or created in a pair depending on the length allowed for the stripe in the corresponding element. The magnetization distribution around the core of the various BP is described in detail as well as the key characteristics of their motion. Finally, some experiments are suggested predicting the behaviour of stripe domains under an applied field.}

The switching field of turned-up magnetization is determined by applying external fields perpendicularly and in tilted directions to the plane. By comparing the MFM results and the magnetization curves measured by a SQUID magnetometer, the switching process of turned-up magnetization is argued.},

  abstract = {Quantum-dot Cellular Automata (QCA) is a computational paradigm that uses local physical coupling between nominally identical bistable building blocks (cells) assembled into arrays to perform binary logic functions. QCA offers low power dissipation and high integration density of functional elements. Depending upon the choice of local fields causing interactions between the cells, different types of QCA are possible, such as magnetic, electronic, or optical. Here we discuss recent developments in the field of magnetic QCA (MQCA) all-magnetic logic where planar, magnetically-coupled, nanometer-scale magnets are assembled into the networks that perform binary computation. The nanomagnets are defined by electron beam lithography. We demonstrate the operation of basic elements of MQCA architecture such as binary wire, three input majority logic gate, and their combination, and discuss interfacing such systems with conventional CMOS-based logic.}

  abstract = {In a wide variety of applications from different scientific and engineering fields, the solution of complex and/or nonsymmetric linear systems of equations is required. To solve this kind of linear systems the BiConjugate Gradient method (BCG) is especially relevant. Nevertheless, BCG has a enormous computational cost. GPU computing is useful for accelerating this kind of algorithms but it is necessary to develop suitable implementations to optimally exploit the GPU architecture. In this paper, we show how BCG can be effectively accelerated when all operations are computed on a GPU. So, BCG has been implemented with two alternative routines of the Sparse Matrix Vector product (SpMV): the CUSPARSE library and the ELLR-T routine. Although our interest is focused on complex matrices, our implementation has been evaluated on a GPU for two sets of test matrices: complex and real, in single and double precision data. Experimental results show that BCG based on ELLR-T routine achieves the best performance, particularly for the set of complex test matrices. Consequently, this method can be useful as a tool to efficiently solve large linear system of equations (complex and/or nonsymmetric) involved in a broad range of applications. \textcopyright{} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed analytical derivation of the spin wave (SW) dispersion relation in magnetic nanotubes with magnetization along the azimuthal direction. The obtained formula can be used to calculate the dispersion relation for any longitudinal and azimuthal mode. The obtained dispersion is asymmetric for all azimuthal modes traveling along the axial direction. As reported in our recent publication [Phys. Rev. Lett. 117, 227203 (2016)], the asymmetry is a curvature-induced effect originating from the dipole-dipole interaction. Here, we discuss the asymmetry of the dispersion for azimuthal modes by analyzing the SW asymmetry f (k z) = f n (k z) - f n (-k z), where f n (k z) is the eigenfrequency of a magnon with a longitudinal and azimuthal wave vectors, k z and n, respectively; and the dependence of the maximum asymmetry with the nanotube radius R. The analytical results are in perfect agreement with micromagnetic simulations. Furthermore, we show that the dispersion relation simplifies to the thin-film dispersion relation with in-plane magnetization when analyzing the three limiting cases: (i) k z = 0, (ii) k z 1/R, and (iii) k z 1/R. In the first case, for the zeroth-order modes the thin-film Kittel formula is obtained. For modes with higher order the dispersion relation for the Backward-Volume geometry is recovered. In the second case, for the zeroth-order mode the exchange dominated dispersion relation for SW in Damon-Esbach configuration is obtained. For the case k z 1/R, we find that the dispersion relation can be reduced to a formula similar to the Kalinikos-Slavin [J. Phys. C: Sol. State Phys. 19, 7013 (1986)] type.},

Based on a dissipative Lagrangian formalism that fully includes damping as well as exchange and dipole-dipole coupling, it is shown that VDW motion is very sensitive to the chirality, giving rise to a chiral asymmetry in the vortex wall propagation. As a consequence, the dynamics of the wall is fundamentally different to that of nanostripes and solid nanowires. Besides the well-known Walker breakdown that stands at the onset of the precessional wall motion, it is found an additional breakdown field (called here the chiral breakdown) that modifies the steady regime of VDWs. We also show outstanding VDWs dynamical properties at low applied fields, as low-field mobilities ( \$\textbackslash sim\$ 10 km / ( sT ) ) and very short relaxation times ( \$\textbackslash sim\$ 1 ns ), offering a reliable fast control of VDWs velocities ( \$\textbackslash sim\$ 1000 m / s at applied fields of 0.7 mT).},

  abstract = {Magnetic bubbles are modeled within a strictly two-dimensional Landau-Lifshitz equation in which the bubble radius is stabilized by a Skyrme-like term together with a suitable uniaxial anisotropy and the nonlocal magnetostatic field is replaced by a local one. The model admits an exact static solution with unit winding number which will be referred to as the fundamental magnetic vortex. We then study numerically the dynamics of a system of two fundamental vortices and show that they orbit around each other on trajectories that exhibit roughly a triangular pattern. In contrast, a vortex-antivortex pair is shown to move in a direction perpendicular to the line connecting the vortex and the antivortex. A very useful guide for understanding our numerical results is provided by the unambiguous conservation laws of the Landau-Lifshitz equation constructed recently.}

  abstract = {The dynamics of magnetic bubbles is studied within a strictly 2D model in which a Skyrme-like term is included to ensure stability. We calculate the profile of static bubbles with unit winding number and then examine two basic dynamical questions. First, we demonstrate that magnetic bubbles exhibit skew deflection in an applied magnetic-field gradient where the semi-empirical golden rule of bubble dynamics is verified in its gross features but not its finer details. Second, we show that two interacting magnetic bubbles with the same winding number orbit around each other while undergoing a mild Larmor precession.}

  abstract = {The canonical conservation laws of linear and angular momentum in the ferromagnetic continuum have been known to be plagued by certain ambiguities which are resolved in this paper by constructing conservation laws as suitable moments of a topological density. The resulting canonical structure is then shown to be analogous to that encountered in the familiar Hall effect and explains the unusual features of the dynamics of magnetic vortices without resorting to a detailed solution of the underlying nonlinear equations. Thus, in the absence of external magnetic fields, a magnetic vortex is shown to be spontaneously pinned around a fixed guiding center. The guiding center would drift in a direction perpendicular to an applied magnetic field gradient, provided that dissipation can be neglected, with a Hall velocity that is calculated explicitly in terms of the initial configuration of the vortex. In the presence of dissipation, the vortex undergoes skew deflection at an angle [delta] [not equal to] 90[deg] with respect to the applied field gradient. The angle [delta] is related to the winding number of the vortex according to the well-known golden rule of bubble dynamics.}

  abstract = {We establish the existence of a finite-energy solitary wave in a two-dimensional planar ferromagnet which moves rigidly at any constant velocity v that is smaller than the magnon velocity c. The shape of the calculated soliton depends crucially on the relative magnitude of v and c. For v\${$<\$\$<\$$}c, the soliton describes a widely separated vortex-antivortex pair undergoing Kelvin motion at a relative distance . There exists a crossover velocity v0 at which the vortex-antivortex character is lost and the energy-momentum dispersion develops a cusp. For v0\${$<\$$}v\${$<\$$}c, the soliton becomes a lump with no apparent topological features and solves the modified KP equation in the limit . We also describe briefly a similar calculation of a vortex ring in a three-dimensional planar ferromagnet. These results together with the analytically known one-dimensional kink provide an interesting set of semitopological solitons whose physical significance is yet to be explored.}

The comparison between the distributions of the anisotropy energy of the particle cores, calculated by multiplying the volume distribution by the core anisotropy, and of the total anisotropy energy, deduced by deriving the master curve of the magnetic relaxation with respect to the scaling variable T ln( t /\cyrchar\CYRP,, 0 ), enables the determination of the surface anisotropy as a function of the particle size. We show that the contribution of the particle surface to the total anisotropy energy can be well described by a size-independent value of the surface energy per unit area which permits the superimposition of the distributions corresponding to the particle core and effective anisotropy energies. The method is applied to a ferrofluid composed of non-interacting Fe 3\cyrchar\cyrv\texteuro ' x O 4 particles of 4.9\cyrchar\CYRV{} nm average size and x about 0.07. Even though the size distribution is quite narrow in this system, a relatively small value of the effective surface anisotropy constant K s = 2.9 \cyrchar\CYRG\textemdash{} 10 \cyrchar\cyrv\texteuro '2 \cyrchar\CYRV{} erg\cyrchar\CYRV{} cm \cyrchar\cyrv\texteuro '2 gives rise to a dramatic broadening of the total energy distribution. The reliability of the average value of the effective anisotropy constant, deduced from magnetic relaxation data, is verified by comparing it to that obtained from the analysis of the shift of the ac susceptibility peaks as a function of the frequency.}

  abstract = {We use spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory (DFT) to study domain walls (DWs) and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in epitaxial films of Co/Ir(111) and Pt/Co/Ir(111). Our measurements reveal DWs with fixed rotational sense on one monolayer of Co on Ir, with a wall width around 2.7 nm. With Pt islands on top, we observe that the DWs occur mostly in the uncovered Co/Ir areas, suggesting that the wall energy density is higher in the Pt/Co/Ir(111). From DFT we find an interfacial DMI that stabilizes N\'eel-type DWs with clockwise rotational sense. The calculated DW widths are in good agreement with the experimental observations. The total DMI nearly doubles from Co/Ir(111) to Pt/Co/Ir(111), however, in the latter case the DMI is almost entirely due to the Pt with only a minor Ir contribution. Therefore a simple additive effect, where both interfaces contribute significantly to the total DMI, is not observed for one atomic Co layer.},

  abstract = {The Landau-Lifshitz equation governing magnetization dynamics is written in terms of the amplitudes of normal modes associated with the micromagnetic system's appropriate ground state. This results in a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, the right-hand side of which can be expressed as the sum of a linear term and nonlinear terms with increasing order of nonlinearity (quadratic, cubic, etc.). The application of the method to nanostructured magnetic systems demonstrates that the accurate description of magnetization dynamics requires a limited number of normal modes, which results in a considerable improvement in computational speed. The proposed method can be used to obtain a reduced-order dynamical description of magnetic nanostructures which allows to adjust the accuracy between low-dimensional models, such as macrospin, and fully spatially discretized micromagnetic models. This new paradigm for micromagnetic simulations is tested for three problems relevant to the areas of spintronics and magnonics: directional spin-wave coupling in magnonic waveguides, high power ferromagnetic resonance in a magnetic nanodot, and injection-locking in spin-torque nano-oscillators. The case studies considered the validity of the proposed approach as a new systematic method to obtain an intermediate order dynamical model based on normal modes for the analysis of magnetic nanosystems. The time-consuming calculation of the normal modes has to be done only one time for the system. These modes can be used to optimize and predict the system response for all possible time-varying external magnetic fields. This is of utmost importance for various applications where a fast and accurate system response is required, such as in electronic circuit simulation software where an accurate response of the magnetic device has to be predicted.},

For a thick cube, a complex spin configuration with an S-type cylindrically asymmetric vortex having two cores on a pair of surfaces while a leaf-like and a C-type states are observed on the other two pairs of cube surfaces. Competition between the geometrical symmetry and magnetic energy minimization condition in ferromagnetic nanocubes leads to the complex spin structure with a spontaneously broken symmetry.}

  abstract = {In this paper we present a study of the phase diagram and critical properties of the square-lattice quantum XY model, with a single-ion anisotropy and spin S = 1, as a function of the anisotropy parameter D. For D less than a critical value DC, which is the critical point for a quantum phase transition at T = 0, the model presents a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This region is adequately described by the self-consistent harmonic approximation. We show that, if we want to use a Schwinger boson theory in this region, we should include fluctuations around the mean-field approximation (which leads to a gauge field) to describe correctly the BKT transition. However both methods are inadequate to describe the large-D phase, and we show that this phase can be studied using the bond operator formalism which gives the correct behaviour for the correlation length as a function of the temperature in the critical point and above. Our results agree with scaling arguments.}

Systems with neighboring cylinders with parallel or anti-parallel direction of the vortex core are considered. For cylinders with a diameter comparable to the vortex core, the stray field acts either to reduce or to enlarge the vortex core size. The polarity of the vortex core can be reversed by applying a magnetic field parallel to the axis of symmetry of the cylinder. The reversal is initiated by the nucleation of magnetic singularities (Bloch points). For systems with parallel vortex core the analysis of the reversal process shows that magnetostatically coupled cylinders have shorter reversal times.},

  abstract = {Calculations of skyrmions in antiferromagnets (AFMs) are presented, and their properties compared with skyrmions in corresponding ferromagnets (FMs). The rates of skyrmion collapse and escape through the boundary of a track, as well as the binding to and collapse at a non-magnetic impurity, are calculated as a function of applied magnetic field. The activation energy for skyrmion annihilation is the same in AFMs and corresponding FMs in the absence of an applied magnetic field. The pre-exponential factor in the Arrhenius rate law is, however, different because skyrmion dynamics is different in the two systems. An applied magnetic field has opposite effects on skyrmions in the two types of materials. In AFMs the rate of collapse of skyrmions as well as the rate of escape through the edge of a magnetic strip decreases slightly with increasing field, while these rates increase strongly for a skyrmion in the corresponding FMs when the field is directed antiparallel to the magnetization in the center of the skyrmion. A non-magnetic impurity is less likely to trap a skyrmion in AFMs especially in the presence of a magnetic field. This, together with the established fact that a spin polarized current moves skyrmions in AFMs in the direction of the current, while in FMs skyrmions move at an angle to the current, demonstrates that skyrmions in AFMs have several advantageous properties over skyrmions in FMs for memory and spintronic devices.},

  abstract = {We study the quantum propagation of a skyrmion in chiral magnetic insulators by generalizing the micromagnetic equations of motion to a finite temperature path integral formalism, using field theoretic tools. Promoting the center of the skyrmion to a dynamic quantity, the fluctuations around the skyrmionic configuration give rise to a time-dependent damping of the skyrmion motion. From the frequency dependence of the damping kernel, we are able to identify the skyrmion mass, thus providing a microscopic description of the kinematic properties of skyrmions. When the free energy is translationally invariant we find the skyrmion mass is finite only at finite temperature. However, if defects are present or a magnetic trap is applied, the skyrmion mass acquires a finite value, even at vanishingly small temperature. We demonstrate that a skyrmion in a confined geometry provided by a magnetic trap behaves as a massive particle owing to its quasi-one dimensional confinement.},

The electric field driven magnetic domain wall motion is observed in iron garnet films. The electric field induced nucleation of vortex state of magnetic nanodots is theoretically predicted and numerically simulated. From the practical point of view the electric field control of micromagnetic structures suggests a low-power approach for spintronics and magnonics.},

The mechanism of this coupling is explored and illustrated by an example of a ferromagnetic M\"obius ring, where a topologically induced domain wall appears as a ground state in the case of strong easy-normal anisotropy. For the M\"obius geometry, the curvilinear form of the exchange interaction produces an additional effective Dzyaloshinskii-like term which leads to the coupling of the magnetochirality of the domain wall and chirality of the M\"obius ring. Two types of domain walls are found, transversal and longitudinal, which are oriented across and along the M\"obius ring, respectively. In both cases, the effect of magnetochirality symmetry breaking is established. The dependence of the ground state of the M\"obius ring on its geometrical parameters and on the value of the easy-normal anisotropy is explored numerically.},

  abstract = {Curvilinear nanomagnets can support magnetic skyrmions stabilized at a local curvature without any intrinsic chiral interactions. Here, we propose a new mechanism to stabilize chiral N\'eel skyrmion states relying on the \emph{gradient} of curvature. We illustrate our approach with an example of a magnetic thin film with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy shaped as a circular indentation. We show that in addition to the topologically trivial ground state, there are two skyrmion states with winding numbers \$\textbackslash pm 1\$ and a skyrmionium state with a winding number \$0\$. These chiral states are formed due to the pinning of a chiral magnetic domain wall at a bend of the nanoindentation due to spatial inhomogeneity of the curvature-induced Dzyaloshinskii\textendash Moriya interaction. The latter emerges due to the gradient of the local curvature at a bend. While the chirality of the skyrmion is determined by the sign of the local curvature, its radius can be varied in a broad range by engineering the position of the bend with respect to the center of the nanoindentation. We propose a general method, which enables one to reduce a magnetic problem for any surface of revolution to the common planar problem by means of proper modification of constants of anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii\textendash Moriya interaction.},

  abstract = {We show that the interaction of the magnetic subsystem of a curved magnet with the magnet curvature results in coupling of a topologically nontrivial magnetization pattern and topology of the object. The mechanism of this coupling is explored and illustrated by an example of ferromagnetic M\"obius ring, where a topologically induced domain wall appears as a ground state in case of strong easy-normal anisotropy. For the M\"obius geometry the curvilinear form of the exchange interaction produces an additional effective Dzyaloshinskii-like term which leads to the coupling of the magnetochirality of the domain wall and chirality of the M\"obius ring. Two types of domain walls are found, transversal and longitudinal, which are oriented across and along the M\"obius ring, respectively. In both cases the effect of magnetochirality symmetry breaking is established. The dependence of the ground state of the M\"obius ring on its geometrical parameters and on the value of the easy-normal anisotropy is explored numerically.},

Due to the nonlinear nature of scattering, such studies are also important for applications ranging from traditional microwave signal processing to novel magnon-based computation. In this work, simulations employing realistic material parameters are used to demonstrate the tunable nature of magnonbased nonlinear properties. The changes are affected through modification of the dispersion relation of the magnetic system. It is demonstrated that the magnon nonlinear response is very sensitive to the sample film thickness while showing a relatively weaker dependence on saturation magnetization. Aside from the contributions to the fundamental understanding of magnons, the results presented are useful for establishing design rules for magnon-based applications.},

  abstract = {We introduce a normal form for the equation which describes nonlinear oscillations of spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNO). The general form of the equation might be reduced to the equation for STNO with uniformly magnetized free layer or to the equation for STNO with free layer in a magnetic vortex state. The equation is used to study the injection-locking problem. The bifurcation diagram for this problem is derived by using as bifurcation parameters the frequency and the amplitude of the ac excitation. Bifurcations lines corresponding to local bifurcations, i.e. the Saddle-node and the Hopf bifurcations, are derived by using linearization, while the lines corresponding to the Homoclinic bifurcation, which is global in nature, are derived numerically. The diagram exhibits universal features in terms of the shape and position of bifurcation lines. When the frequency of the ac excitation is relatively close to the free-running frequency of the oscillator the system is in synchronized state. For small ac amplitudes, the synchronization is lost for values of the ac frequency which imply the crossing of saddle-node bifurcations. For sufficiently larger values of the ac amplitude and for ac frequency smaller that the free-running frequency, the loss of the synchronized state occurs through a more complex bifurcation pattern which involves a sequence of two homoclinic bifurcations and an Hopf bifurcation. The value of frequency corresponding to loss of stability of the synchronized state can be determined analytically through linearization. The above sequence of bifurcations is connected to the presence of a special point in the bifurcation diagram, referred to as Takens-Bogdanov bifurcation.},

Previous work (motivated by the flux phases) has focused on antiferromagnetic chiral order; we construct a model in which the chirality orders ferromagnetically and investigate the model's behaviour as a function of spin. Enlisting the aid of exact diagonalization, spin waves, perturbation theory, and mean fields, we conclude that the model probably has long-ranged chiral order for spin 1 and greater and no non-trivial chiral order for spin 1/2 .}

The spin wave modes generated are diagonally symmetric with respect to the collision point. The non-propagating mode has the highest amplitude along the middle of the width. The frequency of this mode is strongly correlated to the nanowire geometrical dimensions and is independent of the strength of applied field within the range of 0.1 mT to 1 mT. For nanowire with film thickness below 5 nm, a second spin wave harmonic mode is observed. The decay coefficient of the spin wave power suggests that the DWs in a memory device should be at least 300 nm apart for them to be free of interference from the spin waves.}

The investigations result in a phase diagram which contains the boundaries between the regions of one, two and three domains (flower, vortex and double vortex states). While the general features of the phase diagram are derived from energy estimates based on domain theory, the details are obtained using numerical micromagnetics. The two-domain and the three-domain phase can be subdivided into subphases. The comparison between different configurations revealed that a twisted vortex configuration with an S-shaped domain wall replaces the symmetric vortex with a straight wall at larger sizes. The three-domain phase contains two subphases which are symmetric with respect to (1 0 0) and (1 1 0) mirror planes, respectively. The transition from two to three domains occurs into the (1 1 0)-three-domain-state (diagonal state). This structure can be described as a configuration with two (quarter-) circular domain walls in two opposing corners. However, this configuration is energetically favored only in a small region within the phase diagram relative to the (1 0 0)-symmetry three-domain state with straight walls (sandwich state).},

This paper discusses both the assembly and the solution phases of the FEM with special attention to the balance of computation and data movement. We present a GPU assembly algorithm that scales to arbitrary degree polynomials used as basis functions, at the expense of redundant computations. We show how the storage of the stiffness matrix affects the performance of both the assembly and the solution. We investigate two approaches: global assembly into the CSR and ELLPACK matrix formats and matrix-free algorithms, and show the trade-off between the amount of indexing data and stiffness data. We discuss the performance of different approaches in light of the implicit caches on Fermi GPUs and show a speedup over a two-socket 12-core CPU of up to 10 times in the assembly and up to 6 times in the solution phase. We present our sparse matrix-vector multiplication algorithms that are part of a conjugate gradient iteration and show that a matrix-free approach may be up to two times faster than global assembly approaches and up to 4 times faster than NVIDIA's cuSPARSE library, depending on the preconditioner used.},

  abstract = {When a particle is driven with an ac force over an asymmetric potential, it can undergo a ratchet effect that produces a net dc motion of the particle. Ratchet effects have been observed in numerous systems such as superconducting vortices on asymmetric pinning substrates. Skyrmions, stable topological spin textures with particle-like properties, have many similarities to vortices but their behavior is strongly influenced by non-disspative effects arising from a Magnus term in their equation of motion. We show using numerical simulations that pronounced ratchet effects can occur for ac driven skyrmions moving over asymmetric quasi-one-dimensional substrates. We find a new type of ratchet effect called a Magnus-induced transverse ratchet that arises when the ac driving force is applied perpendicular rather than parallel to the asymmetry direction of the substrate. This transverse ratchet effect only occurs when the Magnus term is finite, and the threshold ac amplitude needed to induce it decreases as the Magnus term becomes more prominent. Ratcheting skyrmions follow ordered orbits in which the net displacement parallel to the substrate asymmetry direction is quantized. Skyrmion ratchets represent a new ac current-based method for controlling skyrmion positions and motion for spintronic applications.},

  abstract = {The elementary spin excitations in strongly magnetic materials are collective spin deviations, or spin waves, whose quanta are called magnons. Interest in the experimental and theoretical investigation of magnons attracted many groups worldwide about 4\textendash 6 decades ago and then waned for some time. In recent years, with the advent of the field of spintronics, the area of magnonics has gained renewed attention. New phenomena have been discovered experimentally, and others have been predicted theoretically. In this tutorial, we briefly review the basic concepts of magnons in antiferromagnetic (AF) materials. Initially, we present a semiclassical view of the equilibrium spin configurations and of the antiferromagnetic resonance in AF materials with two types of magnetic anisotropy, easy-axis and easy-plane. Then, we present a quantum theory of magnons for these materials and apply the results to two important AF insulators, MnF2 and NiO. Finally, we introduce the concept of antiferromagnetic magnonic spin current that plays a key role in several phenomena in antiferromagnetic spintronics.},

  abstract = {The analysis of domain wall dynamics is often simplified to one dimensional physics. For domain walls in thin films, more realistic approaches require the description as two dimensional objects. This includes the study of vortices and curvatures along the domain walls as well as the influence of boundary effects. Here we provide a theory in terms of soft modes that allows to analytically study the physics of extended domain walls and their stability. By considering irregular shaped skyrmions as closed domain walls, we analyze their plasticity and compare their dynamics with those of circular skyrmions. Our theory directly provides an analytical description of the the excitation modes of magnetic skyrmions, previously only accessible by sophisticated micromagnetic numerical calculations and spectral analysis. These analytical expressions provide the scaling behaviour of the different physics on parameters that experiments can test.},

Here, we report on an ultrathin magnetic film in which individual skyrmions can be written and deleted in a controlled fashion with local spin-polarized currents from a scanning tunneling microscope. An external magnetic field is used to tune the energy landscape, and the temperature is adjusted to prevent thermally activated switching between topologically distinct states. Switching rate and direction can then be controlled by the parameters used for current injection. The creation and annihilation of individual magnetic skyrmions demonstrates the potential for topological charge in future information-storage concepts.}

For 20 nm-thick Fe dots with diameters close to 60 nm, the vortex is the ground state. The magnetization of the vortex core (140+-50 emu/cm3) and its diameter (19+-4 nm) obtained from polarized neutron scattering are in agreement with simulations.}

  abstract = {A common ploy to reduce the switching current and energy dissipation in spin-transfer-torque driven magnetization switching of shape-anisotropic single-domain nanomagnets is to employ magnets with low saturation magnetization \$M\_s\$ and high shape-anisotropy. The high shape-anisotropy compensates for low \$M\_s\$ to keep the static switching error rate constant. However, this ploy increases the switching delay, its variance in the presence of thermal noise, and the dynamic switching error rate. Using the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with a random torque emulating thermal noise, we show that pumping some excess spin-polarized current into the nanomagnet during switching will keep the mean switching delay and its variance constant as we reduce \$M\_s\$, while still reducing the energy dissipation significantly.}

The search of hopfions in real physical systems is going on for nearly half a century, starting with the seminal work of Faddeev. But so far realizations in solids are missing. Here, we present a theory that identifies magnetic materials featuring hopfions as stable states without the assistance of confinement or external fields. Our results are based on an advanced micromagnetic energy functional derived from a spin-lattice Hamiltonian. Hopfions appear as emergent particles of the classical Heisenberg model. Magnetic hopfions represent three-dimensional particle-like objects of nanometre-size dimensions opening the gate to a new generation of spintronic devices in the framework of a truly three-dimensional architecture. Our approach goes beyond the conventional phenomenological models. We derive material-realistic parameters that serve as concrete guidance in the search of magnetic hopfions bridging computational physics with materials science.},

Uniform magnetic nanowires are the basic structures which were broadly investigated. However, some of their dynamical properties, like: (anti)crossing between the spin wave modes and impact of the magnetic field on the spin wave spectrum, still need to be exploited. We continue this research by investigation of the spin wave dynamics in solid Ni nanowire of the circular cross-section. We use two approaches: semi-analytical calculations and numerical computations based on the finite element method. We solve coupled Landau\textendash Lifshitz and Maxwell equations and consider both dipolar and exchange interactions. We identify the dispersion brunches and their (anti)crossing by plotting the spatial profiles of spin wave amplitudes and magnetostatic potential. We also check how we can tune the spectrum of the modes by application of the external magnetic field and how it affects the modes and their dominating type of interaction.},

  pages = {528},
  abstract = {Since the first edition of this book was published in 1996, tremendous progress has been made in the scientific and engineering disciplines regarding the use of iterative methods for linear systems. The size and complexity of the new generation of linear and nonlinear systems arising in typical applications has grown. Solving the three-dimensional models of these problems using direct solvers is no longer effective. At the same time, parallel computing has penetrated these application areas as it became less expensive and standardized. Iterative methods are easier than direct solvers to implement on parallel computers but require approaches and solution algorithms that are different from classical methods. Iterative Methods for Sparse Linear Systems, Second Edition gives an in-depth, up-to-date view of practical algorithms for solving large-scale linear systems of equations. These equations can number in the millions and are sparse in the sense that each involves only a small number of unknowns. The methods described are iterative, i.e., they provide sequences of approximations that will converge to the solution. This new edition includes a wide range of the best methods available today. The author has added a new chapter on multigrid techniques and has updated material throughout the text, particularly the chapters on sparse matrices, Krylov subspace methods, preconditioning techniques, and parallel preconditioners. Material on older topics has been removed or shortened, numerous exercises have been added, and many typographical errors have been corrected. The updated and expanded bibliography now includes more recent works emphasizing new and important research topics in this field. Audience This book can be used to teach graduate-level courses on iterative methods for linear systems. Engineers and mathematicians will find its contents easily accessible, and practitioners and educators will value it as a helpful resource. The preface includes syllabi that can be used for either a semester- or quarter-length course in both mathematics and computer science.

  abstract = {We present a theory of a detector of terahertz-frequency signals based on an antiferromagnetic (AFM) crystal. The conversion of a THz-frequency electromagnetic signal into the DC voltage is realized using the inverse spin Hall effect in an antiferromagnet/heavy metal bilayer. An additional bias DC magnetic field can be used to tune the antiferromagnetic resonance frequency. We show that if a uniaxial AFM is used, the detection of linearly polarized signals is possible only for a non-zero DC magnetic field, while circularly polarized signals can be detected in a zero DC magnetic field. In contrast, a detector based on a biaxial AFM can be used without a bias DC magnetic field for the rectification of both linearly and circularly polarized signals. The sensitivity of a proposed AFM detector can be increased by increasing the magnitude of the bias magnetic field, or by by decreasing the thickness of the AFM layer. We believe that the presented results will be useful for the practical development of tunable, sensitive and portable spintronic detectors of THz-frequency signals based of the antiferromagnetic resonance (AFMR).},

  abstract = {Spin waves (SWs) in magnetic nanotubes have shown interesting nonreciprocal properties in their dispersion relation, group velocity, frequency linewidth, and attenuation lengths. The reported chiral effects are similar to those induced by the Dzyaloshinskii\textendash Moriya interaction but originating from the dipole\textendash dipole interaction. Here, we show that the isotropic-exchange interaction can also induce chiral effects in the SW transport; the so-called Berry phase of SWs. We demonstrate that with the application of magnetic fields, the nonreciprocity of the different SW modes can be tuned between the fully dipolar governed and the fully exchange governed cases, as they are directly related to the underlying equilibrium state. In the helical state, due to the combined action of the two effects, every single sign combination of the azimuthal and axial wave vectors leads to different dispersions, allowing for a very sophisticated tuning of the SW transport. A disentanglement of the dipole\textendash dipole and exchange contributions so far was not reported for the SW transport in nanotubes. Furthermore, we propose a device based on coplanar waveguides that would allow to selectively measure the exchange or dipole induced SW nonreciprocities. In the context of magnonic applications, our results might encourage further developments in the emerging field of 3D magnonic devices using curved magnetic membranes.},

  abstract = {We have investigated the equilibrium states of ferromagnetic single wall nanotubes by means of atomistic Monte Carlo simulations of a zig-zag lattice of Heisenberg spins on the surface of a cylinder. The main focus of our study is to determine how the competition between short-range exchange (J) and long-range dipolar (D) interactions influences the low temperature magnetic order of the nanotubes as well as the thermal-driven transitions involved. Apart from the uniform and vortex states occurring for dominant J or D, we find that helical states become stable for a range of intermediate values of {$\gamma$} = D/J that depends on the radius and length of the nanotube. Introducing a vorticity order parameter to better characterize helical and vortex states, we find the pseudo-critical temperatures for the transitions between these states and we establish the magnetic phase diagrams of their stability regions as a function of the nanotube aspect ratio. Comparison of the energy of the states obtained by simulation with those of simpler theoretical structures that interpolate continuously between them, reveals a high degree of metastability of the helical structures that might be relevant for their reversal modes.}

Equilibrium configurations and magnetization curves are computed using a reduced two-dimensional model, based on minimization of the micromagnetic free-energy. Two main hysteretic events are found. The first is associated with domain walls reaching the sample edge, the second one with the expulsion of vortices from the interior of the sample. Only the second event leads to a remanent state that is different from the initial ac-demagnetized state. Our analysis shows that the first event corresponds to the nucleation of two regions of field penetration within the sample, while the second event is related to the merging of such regions causing a change of topology of the nonpenetrated part in the center region of the sample.},

These spin waves give rise to rf and dc magnetic moments parallel to the dc field. The major part of the rf magnetic moment lags a quarter-period behind the rf magnetic field so that the susceptibility is almost purely imaginary. The real part of the susceptibility vanishes unless the frequency of the unstable spin waves differs from half the pump frequency. The dc magnetic moment induced by the rf field is always larger than the amplitude of the rf magnetic moment. The theoretically expected variation of the susceptibility with the rf magnetic field is discussed and compared with experimental data. \textcopyright{} 1962 The American Institute of Physics.},

We show that the dynamics of collective excitations has to be classified according to the rank of the so-called gyromatrix . Two extreme cases are particularly important: in the first case (zero gyromatrix) collective excitations behave very much like Newtonian particles of classical mechanics, while in the second case (regular gyromatrix) collective excitations are similar to charged, massless particles in an external magnetic field.},

  abstract = {One of the most fascinating topics in current quantum physics are hybridised systems, in which different quantum resonators are strongly coupled. Prominent examples are circular resonators with high quality factors that allow the coupling of optical whispering gallery modes to microwave cavities or magnon resonances in optomagnonics. Whispering gallery modes play a special role in this endeavour because of their high quality factor and strong localisation, which ultimately increases the overlap of the wavefunctions of quantum particles in hybridised systems. The hybridisation with magnons, the collective quantum excitations of the electron spins in a magnetically ordered material, is of particular interest because magnons can take over two functionalities: due to their collective nature they are robust and can serve as a quantum memory and, moreover, they can act as a wavelength converter between microwave and THz photons. However, the observation of whispering gallery magnons has not yet been achieved due to the lack of efficient excitation schemes for magnons with large wave vectors in a circular geometry. To tackle this problem, we studied nonlinear 3-magnon scattering as a means to generate whispering gallery magnons. This Letter discusses the basics of this nonlinear mechanism in a confined, circular geometry from experimental and theoretical point of view.},

Deposition of magnetic Co/Pt multilayers onto the nanoperforated surface results in an array of magnetic nanodots surrounded by a continuous magnetic film. Following the evolution of the magnetic domain pattern in the system, we suggest that domain walls are pinned on structural inhomogeneities given by the underlying nanoperforated template. Furthermore, a series of micromagnetic simulations was performed in order to understand the modification of the pinning strength of domain walls due to the magnetic interaction between nanodots and the surrounding film. The results of the simulations show that magnetic exchange coupling between the nanodots and the surrounding film strongly influences the pinning behavior of the magnetic domain walls which can be optimized to provide maximal pinning.}

  abstract = {The theory of second-order phase transitions is one of the foundations of modern statistical mechanics and condensed-matter theory. A central concept is the observable order parameter, whose nonzero average value characterizes one or more phases. At large distances and long times, fluctuations of the order parameter(s) are described by a continuum field theory, and these dominate the physics near such phase transitions. We show that near second-order quantum phase transitions, subtle quantum interference effects can invalidate this paradigm, and we present a theory of quantum critical points in a variety of experimentally relevant two-dimensional antiferromagnets. The critical points separate phases characterized by conventional \cyrchar\cyrv\cyrchar\CYRDJE\cyrchar\cyrnje confining\cyrchar\cyrv\cyrchar\CYRDJE\cyrchar{\'\cyrk} order parameters. Nevertheless, the critical theory contains an emergent gauge field and \cyrchar\cyrv\cyrchar\CYRDJE\cyrchar\cyrnje deconfined\cyrchar\cyrv\cyrchar\CYRDJE\cyrchar{\'\cyrk} degrees of freedom associated with fractionalization of the order parameters. We propose that this paradigm for quantum criticality may be the key to resolving a number of experimental puzzles in correlated electron systems and offer a new perspective on the properties of complex materials.}

  abstract = {Inelastic scattering of light by spin waves generates an energy flow between the light and magnetization fields, a process that can be enhanced and controlled by concentrating the light in magneto-optical resonators. Here, we model the cooling of a sphere made of a magnetic insulator, such as yttrium iron garnet, using a monochromatic laser source. When the magnon lifetimes are much larger than the optical ones, we can treat the latter as a Markovian bath for magnons. The steady-state magnons are canonically distributed with a temperature that is controlled by the light intensity. We predict that such a cooling process can significantly reduce the temperature of the magnetic order within current technology.},

We show that the curvature induces two effective magnetic interactions: effective magnetic anisotropy and an effective Dzyaloshinskii-like interaction. We derive an equation of magnetization dynamics and propose a general static solution for the limit case of strong anisotropy. To illustrate our approach, we consider the magnetization structure in a ring wire and a cone surface: ground states in both systems essentially depend on the curvature, excluding strictly tangential solutions for a cone surface even in the case of strong anisotropy. We derive also the spectrum of spin waves in such systems.}

This approach is applied to the description of the gyroscopic dynamics of the classical field with topological defects. The collective-variable Lagrangian description is considered for gyroscopical systems taking into account singularities. Using this method, we describe the dynamics of two-dimensional magnetic solitons. We establish a relation between the gyroscopic force and the singular one. An effective Lagrangian description is discussed for the magnetic soliton dynamics.}

In spite of the firm confidence for more than 70 years, we demonstrate that there is an intimate coupling between volume and surface magnetostatic charges. Evenmore, the physics of curvilinear systems requires existence of a new fundamental magnetostatic charge determined by local characteristics of the surface. As a stark consequence, novel physical nonlocal anisotropy and chiral effects emerge in spatially corrugated magnetic thin films. Besides these fundamental discoveries, this work reassures confidence in theoretical predictions for experimental explorations and novel devices, based on curved thin films.},

Chiral interactions but also curvature effects are tacitly accepted to be local. A prototypical condensed matter example is a local spin-orbit- or curvature-induced Rashba or Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. Here, we introduce a chiral effect, which is essentially nonlocal and resembles itself even in static spin textures living in curvilinear magnetic nanoshells. Its physical origin is the nonlocal magnetostatic interaction. To identify this interaction, we put forth a self-consistent micromagnetic framework of curvilinear magnetism. Understanding of the nonlocal physics of curved magnetic shells requires a curvature-induced geometrical charge, which couples the magnetic sub-system with the curvilinear geometry. The chiral interaction brings about a nonlocal chiral symmetry breaking effect: it introduces handedness in an intrinsically achiral material and enables the design of magnetolectric and ferrotoroidic responses.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of antiferromagnets is a current hot topic in condensed matter physics and spintronics. However, the dynamics of insulating antiferromagnets cannot be excited by an electric current, which is a method usually used to manipulate ferromagnetic metals. Here, we propose to use the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy gradient as an excitation source to manipulate insulating antiferromagnetic textures. We analytically and numerically study the dynamics of an antiferromagnetic skyrmion driven by a magnetic anisotropy gradient. Our analytical calculations demonstrate that such a magnetic anisotropy gradient can effectively drive an antiferromagnetic skyrmion towards the area of lower magnetic anisotropy. The micromagnetic simulations are in good agreement with our analytical solution. Furthermore, the magnetic anisotropy gradient induced velocity of an antiferromagnetic skyrmion is compared with that of a ferromagnetic skyrmion. Our results are useful for the understanding of antiferromagnetic skyrmion dynamics and may open a new way for the design of antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.},

In particular, we examine those aspects that might affect irreproducibility of device performance. While there is a clear picture of the general principles that underlie the properties of the spin torque nano-oscillator, there are a number of details complicating the picture. We suggest that these details are potentially responsible for adversely affecting uniformity of performance from device to device. These details include (1) nonlinearities, (2) the Oersted field, (3) thermal and deterministic noise sources, and (4) non-uniformity of the spin accumulation. We suggest what role that these details might have in determining spin torque dynamics, and suggest particular avenues of investigation that might clarify whether or not these details are indeed responsible for device variability. This article is one of a series devoted to the subject of spin torque in this issue of the Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials.},

We consider the effect of attractive impurity and repulsive impurity placed near the vortex core gyrotropic trajectory. We observed that the gyrotropic frequency is affected by the presence of impurity. The gyrotropic frequency shift depends on the relative position between the impurity and the vortex core gyrotropic trajectory and if impurity is attractive or repulsive. Our results agree with the analytical model and with experimental behavior for the gyrotropic frequency shown in the literature.},

  abstract = {The dynamics of a spinless charged particle under the influence of a magnetic field in curved space is considered. We chose the surface as being a cone defined by a line element in polar coordinates. The geometry of this line element establishes that the motion of the particle can occur on the surface of a cone or an anti-cone. As a consequence of the nontrivial topology of the cone and also because of two-dimensional confinement, the geometric potential should be taken into account. At first, we establish the conditions for the particle describing a circular path in such a context. Because of the presence of the geometric potential, which contains a singular term, we use the self-adjoint extension method in order to describe the dynamics in all space including the singularity. Expressions are obtained for the bound state energies and wave functions.}

The theory has static solutions of a singular nature, but finite energy, characterized by spin directions; the number of such entities is a rigorously conserved constant of motion; they interact with an external meson field through a derivative-type coupling with the spins, akin to the formalism of strong-coupling meson theory. There is a conserved current identifiable with isobaric spin, and another that may be related to hypercharge. The postulates include one constant of the dimensions of length, and another that is conjectured necessarily to have the value \$\textbackslash hslash\$c, or perhaps \$\textbackslash frac12\textbackslash hslash\$c, in the quantized theory.}

We investigate nonlinear ferromagnetic resonance in magnetic nanostructures with discrete spectra of spin-wave modes in the case of allowed 3-magnon scattering processes. These processes result in the splitting of a directly driven spin-wave mode into two secondary modes if a certain excitation threshold is overcome. The 3-magnon splitting manifests itself as a characteristic distortion of the resonance curve, which can be detected in a simple ferromagnetic resonance experiment. Theoretical results are also compared to the experimental study of nonlinear spinwave dynamics in a vortex-state magnetic disk, in which 3magnon splitting is confirmed by direct measurements using Brillouin light scattering microscopy.},

The geometry of spherical shell prohibits an existence of spatially homogeneous magnetization distribution, even in the case of small sample radii. By varying geometrical parameters a continuous phase transition between the whirligig and onion states takes place. The detailed analytical description of the phase diagram is well confirmed by micromagnetic simulations.},

The time derivative of the canonical momentum for a domain of integer winding number is equal to the total force, which must include gyrotropic and dissipative terms. A new contour integral expresses the momentum in the limit of vanishing wall thickness. Approximate equations of quasi-steady domain motion are cast into a form resembling Hamiltion's equations for a particle. Discussion centers on applications to gradientless propagation, bubble saturation velocity, and the Blochline model of inertial effects, and on general limitations of the theory.}

  abstract = {We report on the experimental and analytical work on spin-transfer torque induced vortex dynamics in metallic nanopillars with in-plane magnetized layers. We study nanopillars with a diameter of 150 nm, containing two Fe layers with a thickness of 15 nm and 30 nm, respectively, separated by a 6 nm Ag spacer. The sample geometry is such that it allows for the formation of magnetic vortices in the Fe discs. As confirmed by micromagnetic simulations, we are able to prepare states where one magnetic layer is homogeneously magnetized while the other contains a vortex. We experimentally show that in this configuration spin-transfer torque can excite vortex dynamics and analyse their dependence on a magnetic field applied in the sample plane. The centre of gyration is continuously dislocated from the disc centre, and the potential changes its shape with field strength. The latter is reflected in the field dependence of the excitation frequency. In the second part we propose a novel mechanism for the excitation of the gyrotropic mode in nanopillars with a perfectly homogeneously magnetized in-plane polarizing layer. We analytically show that in this configuration the vortex can absorb energy from the spin-polarized electric current if the angular spin-transfer efficiency function is asymmetric. This effect is supported by micromagnetic simulations.}

  abstract = {Magnetic domains and the walls between are the subject of great interest because of the role they play in determining the electrical properties of ferromagnetic materials and as a means of manipulating electron spin in spintronic devices. However, much less attention has been paid to these effects in antiferromagnets, primarily because there is less awareness of their existence in antiferromagnets, and in addition they are hard to probe since they exhibit no net magnetic moment. In this paper, we discuss the electrical properties of chromium, which is the only elemental antiferromagnet and how they depend on the subtle arrangement of the antiferromagnetically ordered spins. X-ray measurement of the modulation wavevector Q of the incommensurate antiferromagnetic spin-density wave shows thermal hysteresis, with the corresponding wavelength being larger during cooling than during warming. The thermal hysteresis in the Q vector is accompanied with a thermal hysteresis in both the longitudinal and Hall resistivity. During cooling, we measure a larger longitudinal and Hall resistivity compared with when warming, which indicates that a larger wavelength at a given temperature corresponds to a smaller carrier density or equivalently a larger antiferromagnetic ordering parameter compared to a smaller wavelength. This shows that the arrangement of the antiferromagnetic spins directly influences the transport properties. In thin films, the sign of the thermal hysteresis for Q is the same as in thick films, but a distinct aspect is that Q is quantized.}

In recent years, new phases of matter have emerged from the interplay between SOC and low dimensionality, such as chiral spin textures and spin-polarized surface and interface states. These low-dimensional SOC-based realizations are typically robust and can be exploited at room temperature. Here we discuss SOC as a means of producing such fundamentally new physical phenomena in thin films and heterostructures. We put into context the technological promise of these material classes for developing spin-based device applications at room temperature.}

We show that ferrotoroidicity as a form of primary ferroic order can be understood both from microscopic (multipole expansion) and macroscopic (symmetry-based expansion of the free energy) points of view. The definition of the local toroidal moment and its transformation properties under the space-inversion and time reversal operations are highlighted and the extension to periodic bulk systems is discussed. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between the toroidal moment and the antisymmetric magnetoelectric effect and to limitations of the magnetoelectric response in ferrotoroidic systems and ferroic materials in general. Experimental access to the ferrotoroidic state by magnetoelectric susceptibility measurements, x-ray diffraction and optical techniques or direct measurement of the bulk toroidization is discussed. We outline the pertinent questions that should be clarified for continued advancement of the field and mention some potential applications of ferrotoroidic materials.},

It then examines the relevant experimental capabilities that are currently available at hard X-ray synchrotron light sources, using the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne as an example. Finally, recommendations are made for future development in X-ray facilities that will enhance the study of nanomagnetism, including new experimental directions, modifications that would enable in situ sample preparation, and measurements at high magnetic fields and/or low temperatures. In particular, in situ sample preparation is of high priority in many experiments, especially those in the area of surface magnetism.},

  abstract = {Spin Waves: Theory and Applications covers topics foundational to understanding spin waves such as the physics of magnetism and electromagnetic waves in anisotropic media, as well as both classical and quantum mechanical treatments of spin wave excitations. The authors discuss many applications including microwave delay lines, spin wave-optical devices, and microwave oscillations induced by spin transfer torques in multilayer structures. The material provides explanations and developments of concepts that assist students and researchers interested in beginning work on topics related to magnetic excitations. The book can be divided into three major parts. The first is comprised of Chapters 1-4 and is concerned with the physics of magnetism and electromagnetic waves in magnetic media. The second part, Chapters 5-8, focuses on magnetostatic modes and dipolar spin waves, their properties, how to excite them, and how they interact with light. Finally, Chapters 9 and 10 treat nonlinear phenomena and advanced applications of spin wave excitations. Spin Waves: Theory and Applications provides an introduction to an active area of research and a handy reference for workers in the field. The material is useful for graduate students in physics, materials science, or electrical engineering as well as active researchers in fundamental and applied magnetism.

  abstract = {We propose a review of the current knowledge about the synthesis, magnetic properties and applications of magnetic cylindrical nanowires and nanotubes. By "nano" we consider diameters reasonably smaller than a micrometer. At this scale, comparable to micromagnetic and transport length scales, novel properties appear. At the same time, this makes the underlying physics easier to understand due to the limiter number of degrees of freedom involved. The three-dimensional nature and the curvature of these objects contribute also to their specific properties, compared to patterns flat elements. While the topic of nanowires and later nanotubes started now decades ago, it is nevertheless flourishing, thanks to the progress of synthesis, theory and characterization tools. These give access to ever more complex and thus functional structures, and also shifting the focus from material-type measurements of large assemblies, to single-object investigations. We first provide an overview of common fabrication methods yielding nanowires, nanotubes and structures engineered in geometry\$\textbackslash sim\$(change in diameter, shape) or material (segments, core-shell structures), shape or core-shell. We then review their magnetic properties: global measurements, magnetization states and switching, single domain wall statics and dynamics, and spin waves. For each aspect, both theory and experiments are surveyed. We also mention standard characterization techniques useful for these. We finally mention emerging applications of magnetic nanowires and nanotubes, along with the foreseen perspectives in the topic.},

  abstract = {Magnetic skyrmions can be considered as topologically protected localized vortex-like spin textures. Due to their stability, their small size, and the possibility to move them by low electric currents they are promising candidates for spintronic devices. Without violating topological protection, it is possible to create skyrmion-antiskyrmion pairs, as long as the total charge remains unchanged. We derive a skyrmion equation of motion which reveals how spin-polarized charge currents create skyrmion-antiskyrmion pairs. It allows to identify general prerequisites for the pair creation process. We corroborate these general principles by numerical simulations. On a lattice, where topological protection becomes imperfect, the antiskyrmion partner of the pairs is annihilated and only the skyrmion survives. This eventually changes the total skyrmion number and yields a new way of creating and controlling skyrmions.},

  abstract = {Extending planar two-dimensional structures into the three-dimensional space has become a general trend in multiple disciplines, including electronics, photonics, plasmonics and magnetics. This approach provides means to modify conventional or to launch novel functionalities by tailoring the geometry of an object, e.g. its local curvature. In a generic electronic system, curvature results in the appearance of scalar and vector geometric potentials inducing anisotropic and chiral effects. In the specific case of magnetism, even in the simplest case of a curved anisotropic Heisenberg magnet, the curvilinear geometry manifests two exchange-driven interactions, namely effective anisotropy and antisymmetric exchange, i.e. Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like interaction. As a consequence, a family of novel curvature-driven effects emerges, which includes magnetochiral effects and topologically induced magnetization patterning, resulting in theoretically predicted unlimited domain wall velocities, chirality symmetry breaking and Cherenkov-like effects for magnons. The broad range of altered physical properties makes these curved architectures appealing in view of fundamental research on e.g. skyrmionic systems, magnonic crystals or exotic spin configurations. In addition to these rich physics, the application potential of three-dimensionally shaped objects is currently being explored as magnetic field sensorics for magnetofluidic applications, spin-wave filters, advanced magneto-encephalography devices for diagnosis of epilepsy or for energy-efficient racetrack memory devices. These recent developments ranging from theoretical predictions over fabrication of three-dimensionally curved magnetic thin films, hollow cylinders or wires, to their characterization using integral means as well as the development of advanced tomography approaches are in the focus of this review.},

They are ultrathin and light, in addition, it will be realized the flexible display to utilize the flexibility of the substrate. The key issue in achieving such displays is how to protect OLEDs from moisture and oxygen. We developed a barrier film on a plastic substrate and a passivation film on the OLED device itself. As a result, the device showed good emission characteristics after storage, and its characteristics were almost the same as those of a device fabricated on a glass substrate. We also developed a 3-in full-color flexible OLED display.},

  abstract = {Bloembergen and Wang, as well as Damon, have observed two anomalous effects in the microwave absorption of ferromagnets at high signal powers: a saturation of the usual resonance at powers far below those thought to be necessary on the basis of the observed relaxation time, and the appearance, at similar signal levels, of a rather broad secondary absorption peak some hundreds of oersteds below the d.c. field required for resonance. It is shown that these effects are connected with two kinds of instability of the uniform precessional motion of the total magnetization against certain spin-wave disturbances. These disturbances will grow, exponentially to begin with, when the signal level exceeds certain threshold values. It turns out to be possible to calculate the new final state attained by the medium in the case of the subsidiary absorption; in this state the uniform precession limits at a fixed value, no matter how large the signal, whereas a narrow range of spin waves is excited to a large nonthermal value which increases steadily with signal power. The susceptibilities calculated in the new regime check the experiments quite well. Some predictions of the theory beyond the above-mentioned observations have also been verified. A simplified, less rigorous treatment has already been given elsewhere. In the present paper a more complete theory is developed, with special emphasis on the new state of the medium beyond the threshold. \textcopyright{} 1957.},

  abstract = {Levinson's theorem is proved for the elastic, two-body scattering of both neutral and of charged particles, for arbitrary angular momentum states. The necessary restriction on the interaction potential U(r) is r2U(r)=0 at R=0 and R=[infinity], with U(r{$>$}0) finite. The theorem also applies to the equivalent two-body potential between complex particles. Levinson's relation for the l-wave phase-shift [eta]l(k) gives [eta]l(0)-[eta]l([infinity])=[eta]l[pi], with [eta]l([infinity])=0, where [eta]l is the number of composite bound states. If there is an l=0 resonance at zero energy, this is modified to . Coulomb bound states do not obey this relation, as r2V(r)[not equal to]0 at r=[infinity]. The special case of the inverse square potential, in those cases where [eta]l(k) can be defined, gives the result [eta]l(k)=constant for all k. Attractive potential wells with repulsive singular cores, not obeying the restriction r2U(r)=0 at r=0, are shown to lead to [eta]l(0)=[eta]l[pi], [eta]l([ infinity])=-const.[kappa]p, 0[equal-or-less, slanted]p[equal-or-less, slanted]1, where p increases from 0 to 1 as the order of the singularity increases from 2 to [infinity]. The values of [eta]l(0) and [eta]l([infinity]) largely condition the shape of the [eta]l(k) function, which is otherwise arbitrary by integral multiples of [pi]. Examples of the variationof [eta]0(k) with k and potential well strength are given graphically for the square well. Their behaviour is related to the general properties [eta]l(k\textendash{$>$}0) [is proportional to] k2l+1 and [eta]l(k\textendash{$>$}[infinity]) [is proportional to] 1/k, and to the existence of shape resonance scattering masked by hard sphere (potential) scattering.}

We first microscopically derive an equation of motion for the N\cyrchar\CYRG\textcopyright el vector in the presence of current by performing, in the transport steady state, a linear-response calculation in the deviation from collinearity of the antiferromagnet. This equation of motion is then solved variationally for an antiferromagnetic domain wall. We find that, in the absence of dissipative or non-adiabatic coupling between magnetization and current, the current displaces the domain wall by a finite amount and that the domain wall is then intrinsically pinned by the exchange interactions. In the presence of dissipative or non-adiabatic current-to-domain-wall coupling, the domain wall velocity is proportional to the current and is no longer pinned.}

Extending the result to a superconducting device, we find that the spin accumulation signal is strongly enhanced by opening of the superconducting gap since a gapped superconductor is a low carrier system for spin transport but not for charge. The enhancement is also expected in semiconductor devices.},

Even if the linear velocity of the object is smaller than the Landau critical velocity, the object may radiate quasiparticles and thus experience the quantum friction. The radiation process is similar to Zel'dovich-Starobinsky (ZS) effect - the radiation by a rotating black hole. This analogy emerges when one introduces the effective acoustic metric for quasiparticles. In the rotating frame this metric has an ergosurface, which is similar to the ergosurface in the metric of a rotating black hole. In a finite size BEC, the quasiparticle creation takes place when the ergosurface is within the condensate and occurs via quantum tunneling from the object into the ergoregion. The dependence of the radiation rate on the position of the ergosurface is investigated.}

Materials with small uniaxial anisotropy typically demonstrate vortex structures, while a higher anisotropy leads to the formation of concentric cylindrical magnetic bubbles inside the cylinder and a monodomain flower state.}

Injection was achieved by pushing selected lines into a region where the surface had been ion-implanted, resulting in a modification of the spins orientation along the line at surface level. The optical observation of lines relies on an anisotropic dark field imaging technique developed earlier. Direct confirmation of the micromagnetic picture of a Bloch point-containing line is obtained.}

We show that it explains, with reasonable parameters, the measured DW velocities as well as the variation of DW propagation field under current. We also introduce coercivity by considering rough wires. This leads to a finite DW propagation field and finite threshold current for DW propagation, hence we conclude that threshold currents are extrinsic. Some possible models that support this new term are discussed.}

The force integral corresponging to the gyroscopic term is found to be even less sensitive to the details of the spin distribution than the dissipative drag integral. Hard magnetic bubble domains are considered as an illustrative example.}

  abstract = {In this thesis, we consider the dynamics of vortices in the easy plane insulating ferromagnet in two dimensions. In addition to the quasiparticle excitations, here spin waves or magnons, this magnetic system admits a family of vortex solutions carrying two topological invariants, the winding number or vorticity, and the polarization. A vortex is approximately described as a particle moving about the system, endowed with an effective mass and acted upon by a variety of forces. Classically, the vortex has an inter-vortex potential energy giving a Coulomb-like force (attractive or repulsive depending on the relative vortex vorticity), and a gyrotropic force, behaving as a self-induced Lorentz force, whose direction depends on both topological indices. Expanding semiclassically about a many-vortex solution, the vortices are quantized by considering the scattered magnon states, giving a zero point energy correction and a many-vortex mass tensor. The vortices cannot be described as independent particles\textendash that is, there are off-diagonal mass terms, such as 1/2 Mij vi vj, that are non-negligible. This thesis examines the full vortex dynamics in further detail by evaluating the Feynman-Vernon influence functional, which describes the evolution of the vortex density matrix after the magnon modes have been traced out. In addition to the set of forces already known, we find new damping forces acting both longitudinally and transversely to the vortex motion. The vortex motion within a collective cannot be entirely separated: there are damping forces acting on one vortex due to the motion of another. The effective damping forces have memory effects: they depend not only on the current motion of the vortex collection but also on the motion history.}

The dimensions and lateral density of the array are determined by segmental interactions and the copolymer molecular weight. Through direct current electrodeposition, we fabricated vertical arrays of nanowires with densities in excess of 1.9 x 10\textsuperscript{11\$} wires per square centimeter. We found markedly enhanced coercivities with ferromagnetic cobalt nanowires that point toward a route to ultrahigh-density storage media. The copolymer approach described is practical, parallel, compatible with current lithographic processes, and amenable to multilayered device fabrication.}

  abstract = {Strong interest in nanomagnetism stems from the promise of high storage densities of information through control of ever smaller and smaller ensembles of spins. There is a broad consensus that the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation reliably describes the magnetization dynamics on classical phenomenological level. On the other hand, it is not so evident that the magnetization dynamics governed by this equation contains built-in asymmetry in the case of broad topology sets of symmetric total energy functional surfaces. The magnetization dynamics in such cases shows preference for one particular state from many energetically equivalent available minima. We demonstrate this behavior on a simple one-spin model which can be treated analytically. Depending on the ferromagnet geometry and material parameters, this asymmetric behavior can be robust enough to survive even at high temperatures opening simplified venues for controlling magnetic states of nanodevices in practical applications. Using micromagnetic simulations we demonstrate the asymmetry in magnetization dynamics in a real system with reduced symmetry such as Pacman-like nanodot. Exploiting the built-in asymmetry in the dynamics could lead to practical methods of preparing desired spin configurations on nanoscale.}

  year = {2018},
  journal = {ArXiv e-prints},
  abstract = {In this work we have used micromagnetic simulations to report four ways to build traps for magnetic skyrmions. Magnetic defects have been modeled as local variations in the material parameters, such as the exchange stiffness, saturation magnetization, magnetocrystalline anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya constant. We observe both pinning (potential well) and scattering (potential barrier) traps when tuning either a local increase or a local reduction for each one of these magnetic properties. It is found that the skyrmion-defect aspect ratio is a crucial parameter to build traps for skyrmions. In particular, the efficiency of the trap is compromised if the defect size is smaller than the skyrmion size, because they interact weakly. On the other hand, if the defect size is larger than the skyrmion diameter, the skyrmion-defect interaction becomes evident. Thus, the strength of the skyrmion-defect interaction can be tuned by the modification of the magnetic properties within a region with suitable size. Furthermore, the basic physics behind the mechanisms for pinning and for scattering is discussed. In particular, we discover that skyrmions move towards the magnetic region which tends to maximize its diameter, it enables the magnetic system to minimize its energy. Thus, we are able to explain why skyrmions are either attracted or repelled by a region with modified magnetic properties. Results here presented are of utmost significance for the development and realization of future spintronic devices, in which skyrmions will work as information carriers.},

  abstract = {The Anderson-Hubbard (A-H) model with one or two holes and with periodic boundary conditions on a 4M x 4N square lattice is considered. On grounds of an intuitive generalization of Marshall's theorem we split the A-H Hamiltonian (HA-H) into a zeroth order term (H0) and a perturbation term (H'). With H0 we construct unfrustrated states: the zeroth order approximation of the degenerate ground state (GS). The one-hole system has a four-fold symmetry broken H0-GS with K = ([pi]/2, +/-[pi]/2), (-[pi]/2, +/-[pi]/2). Group theory shows that this symmetry breaking (SB) may be stable if H' is taken into account. For the two-hole system we derive candidates for the H0-GS with the corresponding good quantum numbers k and total spin S. Here we find no SB or a two-fold SB: again, this result may hold for the complete HA-H. Second order perturbation calculation possibly describes an effective coupling of two holes.}

Similar effects can be achieved by a significant surface roughness in the film. We show that in general the anisotropy can point in an arbitrary direction depending on the surface curvature. We provide simple examples of these periodic surface structures to demonstrate how to engineer particular anisotropies in the film.},

  abstract = {Vector Hamiltonian formalism (VHF) for the description of a weakly nonlinear magnetization dynamics has been developed. Transformation from the traditional Landau-Lifshitz equation, describing dynamics of a magnetization vector \$\textbackslash vec\{m\}(\textbackslash vec\{r\}, t)\$ on a sphere, to a vector Hamiltonian equation, describing dynamics of a \textbackslash emph\{spin excitation vector\} \$\textbackslash vec\{s\}(\textbackslash vec\{r\}, t)\$ on a plane, is done using the azimuthal Lambert transformation that preserves both the phase-space area and vector structure of dynamical equations, and guarantees that the plane containing vector \$\textbackslash vec\{s\}(\textbackslash vec\{r\}, t)\$ is at each value of the coordinate \$\textbackslash vec\{r\}\$ perpendicular to the a stationary vector \$\textbackslash vec\{m\}\_0(\textbackslash vec\{r\})\$ describing the magnetization ground state of the system. By expanding vector \$\textbackslash vec\{s\}(\textbackslash vec\{r\}, t)\$ in a complete set of linear magnetic vector eigemodes \$\textbackslash vec\{s\}\_\textbackslash nu(\textbackslash vec\{r\})\$ of the studied system, and using a weakly nonlinear approximation \$|\textbackslash vec\{s\}(\textbackslash vec\{r\}, t)| \textbackslash ll 1\$, it is possible to express the Hamiltonian function of the system in the form of integrals over the vector eigenmode profiles \$\textbackslash vec\{s\}\_\textbackslash nu(\textbackslash vec\{r\})\$, and calculate all the coefficients of this Hamiltonian. The developed approach allows one to describe weakly nonlinear dynamics in micro- and nano-scale magnetic systems with complicated geometries and spatially non-uniform ground states by numerically calculating linear spectrum and eigenmode profiles, and semi-analytically evaluating amplitudes of multi-mode nonlinear interactions. Examples of applications of the developed formalism to the magnetic systems having spatially nonuniform ground state of magnetization are presented.},

  abstract = {We raise the possibility that the chiral degeneracy of the magnons in ultrathin films can be lifted due to the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. By using simple symmetry arguments, we discuss under which conditions such a chiral asymmetry occurs. We then perform relativistic first principles calculations for an Fe monolayer on W(110) and explicitly reveal the asymmetry of the spin-wave spectrum in the case of wave vectors parallel to the (001) direction. Furthermore, we quantitatively interpret our results in terms of a simplified spin model by using calculated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya vectors. Our theoretical prediction should inspire experiments to explore the asymmetry of spin waves, with a particular emphasis on the possibility to measure the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in ultrathin films. \textcopyright{} 2009 The American Physical Society.}

  abstract = {A spin-pumping antiferromagnet                            Antiferromagnets have been used in spintronics mainly as a source of the so-called exchange bias. However, they hold promise for a much more active role given that their magnetization dynamics can in principle be much faster than those in ferromagnets. For this promise to materialize, antiferromagnets must learn the tricks that come naturally to ferromagnets. Vaidya               et al.               observed one such phenomenon called spin pumping (see the Perspective by Hoffmann). The researchers irradiated the antiferromagnet MnF               2               with circularly polarized subterahertz light, causing the spins in this material to spring into action. These dynamics, in turn, caused the injection of spin current into a layer of platinum adjacent to MnF               2               .                                         Science               , this issue p.               160               ; see also p.               135                        ,                             Spin dynamics in antiferromagnetic MnF               2               cause the injection of spin current into an adjacent platinum layer.                        ,              Spin-transfer torque and spin Hall effects combined with their reciprocal phenomena, spin pumping and inverse spin Hall effects (ISHEs), enable the reading and control of magnetic moments in spintronics. The direct observation of these effects remains elusive in antiferromagnetic-based devices. We report subterahertz spin pumping at the interface of the uniaxial insulating antiferromagnet manganese difluoride and platinum. The measured ISHE voltage arising from spin-charge conversion in the platinum layer depends on the chirality of the dynamical modes of the antiferromagnet, which is selectively excited and modulated by the handedness of the circularly polarized subterahertz irradiation. Our results open the door to the controlled generation of coherent, pure spin currents at terahertz frequencies.},

For the specific example of a ferromagnetic spin spiral, we compute the inverse spin Hall effect voltage this spin current gives rise to when injected into a Pt layer. Furthermore, we show that this pure spin current leads to modification of the parameters that govern spin transfer and current-driven domain-wall motion, which can be used to tune the latter in layered magnetic systems. This effect in principle enables in situ control over the location, magnitude, and polarization of spin-current injection in devices.},

  abstract = {Finite-element micromagnetic simulations are employed to study the chiral symmetry breaking of magnetic vortices, caused by the surface roughness of thin-film magnetic structures. An asymmetry between vortices with different core polarizations has been experimentally observed for square-shaped platelets. For example, the threshold fields for vortex core switching were found to differ for core up and down. This asymmetry was, however, not expected for these symmetrically shaped structures, where both core polarizations should behave symmetrically. Three-dimensional finite element simulations are employed to show that a small surface roughness can break the symmetry between vortex cores pointing up and down. A relatively small sample roughness is found to be sufficient to reproduce the experimentally observed asymmetries. It arises from the lack of mirror-symmetry of the rough thin-film structures, which causes vortices with different handedness to exhibit asymmetric dynamics.}

  abstract = {The vortex state, characterized by a curling magnetization, is one of the equilibrium configurations of soft magnetic materials and occurs in thin ferromagnetic square and disk-shaped elements of micrometre size and below. The interplay between the magnetostatic and the exchange energy favours an in-plane, closed flux domain structure. This curling magnetization turns out of the plane at the centre of the vortex structure, in an area with a radius of about 10 nanometres\textendash the vortex core. The vortex state has a specific excitation mode: the in-plane gyration of the vortex structure about its equilibrium position. The sense of gyration is determined by the vortex core polarization. Here we report on the controlled manipulation of the vortex core polarization by excitation with small bursts of an alternating magnetic field. The vortex motion was imaged by time-resolved scanning transmission X-ray microscopy. We demonstrate that the sense of gyration of the vortex structure can be reversed by applying short bursts of the sinusoidal excitation field with amplitude of about 1.5 mT. This reversal unambiguously indicates a switching of the out-of-plane core polarization. The observed switching mechanism, which can be understood in the framework of micromagnetic theory, gives insights into basic magnetization dynamics and their possible application in data storage.},

Three- and four-magnon processes are shown to cause this nonlinearity with a strong dependence on magnetic bias field, microwave frequency, and applied power. Predictions are calculated using large-scale micromagnetic simulations executed on graphics processing units (GPUs) and include thermal fluctuations. A 2-D simulation paradigm is proposed for reducing the resource requirements while being able to capture the qualitative and quantitative behavior of the significant microwave-ferromagnet interactions in the parallel pumping configuration. A mathematical formalism specific to thin films is then developed to explain the aforementioned behavior of such magnetic materials based on their predicted magnon dispersion relation. The simulated predictions for high-power (nonlinear) performance are in close agreement with experiment even though the material parameters are only taken from low-power (linear) data.},

  abstract = {A general perturbation theory for the description of weak damping of linear spin-wave modes in magnetic nanostructures is developed. This perturbative approach allows one to account for the usual uniform Gilbert damping, as well as for the spatially nonuniform (coordinate-dependent) and nonlocal (magnetization-texture-dependent) Gilbert-like dissipation mechanisms. Using the derived general expression, it is possible to calculate the damping rate of a particular spin-wave mode if the frequency and the spatial profile of this mode, along with the relevant parameters of a magnetic material, are known. The examples demonstrating the applications of the developed general formalism include (i) generalization of the damping rate of a spin-wave mode propagating in a magnetic sample for the case of a nonuniform static magnetization or/and bias magnetic field, (ii) calculation of a damping rate of a gyrotropic mode in a vortex-state magnetic nanodot, (iii) evaluation of the spin diffusion influence on the damping rate of spin-wave modes in a conducting ferromagnet, and (iv) calculation of damping rates of spin-wave modes in a ferromagnetic film in the presence of a spin pumping into an adjacent nonmagnetic metal layer. The developed formalism is especially useful in micromagnetic simulations, as it allows one to calculate damping rates of spin-wave modes based on the numerical solution of a conservative eigenmode problem.},

  abstract = {A general theory of collective spin wave (SW) excitations in two-dimensional arrays of magnetic nanodots coupled by magneto-dipolar interaction is presented. The theory is applicable for the calculation of the frequency spectra, damping rates, excitation efficiencies, and other characteristics of collective SW excitations in finite and infinite periodic nanodot arrays consisting of nanodots of arbitrary shape and having arbitrary lattice geometry. In particular, the general theory was used for the following applications: (i) Calculation of the SW spectra in arrays of cylindrical nanodots having both square and hexagonal lattices; (ii) analysis of the influence of different point defects of the lattice structure on the SW mode profiles and microwave absorption properties of nanodot arrays; (iii) derivation of the conditions of nonreciprocity of the collective SWs propagating in nanodot arrays. \textcopyright{} 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {We use vector Hamiltonian formalism (VHF) to study theoretically three-magnon parametric interaction (or three-wave splitting) in a magnetic disk existing in a magnetic vortex ground state. The three-wave splitting in a disk is found to obey two selection rules: (i) conservation of the total azimuthal number of the resultant spin-wave modes, and (ii) inequality for the radial numbers of interacting modes, if the mode directly excited by the driving field is radially symmetric (i.e. if the azimuthal number of the directly excited mode is \$m = 0\$). The selection rule (ii), however, is relaxed in the "small" magnetic disks, due to the influence of the vortex core. We also found, that the efficiency of the three-wave interaction of the directly excited mode strongly depends on the azimuthal and radial mode numbers of the resultant modes, that becomes determinative in the case when several splitting channels (several pairs of resultant modes) simultaneously approximately satisfy the resonance condition for the splitting. The good agreement of the VHF analytic calculations with the experiment and micromagnetic simulations proves the capability of the VHF formalism to predict the actual splitting channels and the magnitudes of the driving field thresholds for the three-wave splitting.},

Among the phenomena related to the interplay between geometry and magnetic behavior at nanomagnets, an effective curvature-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction has been recently predicted. In this work, it is shown that a magnetization configuration consisting of two structures with opposite winding numbers (vortex and antivortex) appear as remanent states. It is shown that these topological chiral configurations are a result of the Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya interaction induced by curvature. In this way, the obtained results present a new form to produce stable vortices and antivortices by using nanomagnets with variable curvature.},

  abstract = {The main origin of the chiral symmetry breaking and, thus, for the magnetochiral effects in magnetic materials is associated with an antisymmetric exchange interaction, the intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Recently, numerous inspiring theoretical works predict that the bending of a thin film to a curved surface is often sufficient to induce similar chiral effects. However, these originate from the exchange or magnetostatic interactions and can stabilize noncollinear magnetic structures or influence spin-wave propagation. Here, we demonstrate that curvature-induced chiral effects are experimentally observable rather than theoretical abstraction and are present even in conventional soft ferromagnetic materials. We show that, by measuring the depinning field of domain walls in the simplest possible curve, a flat parabolic stripe, the effective exchange-driven DMI interaction constant can be quantified. Remarkably, its value can be as high as the interfacial DMI constant for thin films and can be tuned by the parabola's curvature.},

The magnetization behavior is analyzed for stripes with various widths and for all range of the applied current density. It is established that \O rsted field does not destroy periodical magnetization structures induced by the spin-torque, e.g. vortex-antivortex crystal and cross-tie domain walls. However, the action of the \O rsted field disables the saturation state for the strong currents: a stationary state with a single longitudinal domain wall appears instead. Shape of this wall remains constant with the current increasing. The latter phenomenon is studied both numerically and analytically.}

In contrast, for 2D Heisenberg antiferromagnets it is argued that localized excitations play no role for the spin correlation length [xi] although such excitations were described by Skyrme (Skyrmions) long ago. These arguments will be revisited. Further, the spatial measurements of the spin correlation length [xi] and the temporal observations as measured by the line broadening of electron spin resonance lines, both measured in the regime far above TN3D, will be compared with the model proposed by Belavin and Polyakov which considers thermal excitation of Skyrmions.}

  abstract = {Abstract A real-space phase field model is developed to investigate the effect of Dzyaloshinsky\textendash Moriya (DM) interaction on magnetic vortex in ultrathin ferromagnetic film. Based on the time-dependent Ginzburg\textendash Landau (TDGL) equation, the phase field model takes into account the DM interaction of magnetizations, which includes the coupling between the magnetization and magnetization gradient. The governing equations in the phase field model are solved simultaneously by means of a nonlinear finite elements method, which can be employed to simulate magnetization vortex without periodic boundary condition. The simulation results demonstrate that the DM interaction has significant influence on the structure of the magnetization vortex. It is found that the DM interaction induces an out-of-plane magnetization on the edge of the vortex and enlarges the size of the vortex core. The magnitude of the out-of-plane magnetization at the vortex core and the edge increases with the increase of DM constant. Besides, the handedness of magnetization vortex also changes when the sign of DM constant changes.}

The latter is engineered to feature bends along the height: these are used as pinning sites for domain walls, which are obtained at remanence after saturation of the nanostructure in a horizontally applied magnetic field. The presence of domain walls is investigated using x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) coupled to photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM). The vertical geometry of our sample combined with the low incidence of the x-ray beam produce an extended wire shadow which we use to recover the wire's magnetic configuration. In this transmission configuration, the whole sample volume is probed, thus circumventing the limitation of PEEM to surfaces. This article reports on the first study of magnetic nanostructures standing perpendicular to the substrate with XMCD-PEEM. The use of this technique in shadow mode enabled us to confirm the presence of a domain wall without direct imaging of the nanowire.}

The underlying functional dependency of domain and boundary variables entails a sparsity decrease of the system matrix with an increasing surface area to volume ratio. Such a case is commonly at hand if systems with a high aspect ratio are considered. Therefore, we also propose an effective way which allows for the treatment of such systems in a simplified two-dimensional form without neglecting the threedimensional characteristics of the external field. The approach is tested for the cases of a three-dimensional homogeneously magnetized sphere and a thin magnetic sheet.},

The reason for this limit is well understood in terms of separation of the characteristic time scales between slow degrees of freedom (the magnetization) and fast degrees of freedom. The fast degrees of freedom are introduced as the variation of the angular momentum responsible for the inertia. In order to study the effect of the fast degrees of freedom on the precession, we calculate the geometric phase of the magnetization (i.e. the Hannay angle) and the corresponding magnetic monopole. In the case of the pure precession (the slow manifold), a simple expression of the magnetic monopole is given as a function of the slowness parameter, i.e. as a function of the ratio of the slow over the fast characteristic times.}

In this paper, micromagnetic simulations are employed to study the vortex core switching behaviour excited by a short in-plane Gaussian current pulse. We find that both the switching mechanism and the switching time are not sensitive to changes in the phenomenological parameters of spin-torque nonadiabaticity and Gilbert damping. The switching time, however, strongly depends on the current strength. In addition, we have theoretically predicted the parameter range of current pulses to achieve a single switching event.}

Hence the new nonuniform state plays an intermediate role in the evolution from the quasiuniform state to the vortex state as the diameter increases.},

  abstract = {Ferromagnetic materials have been utilized as recording media in data storage devices for many decades. The confinement of a material to a two-dimensional plane is a significant bottleneck in achieving ultra-high recording densities, and this has led to the proposition of three-dimensional (3D) racetrack memories that utilize domain wall propagation along the nanowires. However, the fabrication of 3D magnetic nanostructures of complex geometries is highly challenging and is not easily achieved with standard lithography techniques. Here, we demonstrate a new approach to construct 3D magnetic nanostructures of complex geometries using a combination of two-photon lithography and electrochemical deposition. The magnetic properties are found to be intimately related to the 3D geometry of the structure, and magnetic imaging experiments provide evidence of domain wall pinning at the 3D nanostructured junction.}

Linear stability analysis applied to YZ kinks shows that there is a velocity-dependent critical field necessary for stability. The authors also present a set of results of a numerical integration of the equations of motion which verifies the YZ kink stability regimes, as well as showing that XY kinks are stable over a wide range of fields and velocities.}

  abstract = {Vortex states in thin circular magnetic nanodots are studied using auxiliary constraining fields as a way to map out the potential energy space of a vortex, while avoiding a rigid vortex approximation. In the model, isotropic Heisenberg exchange competes with the demagnetization field caused by both surface and volume magnetization charge densities. The system energy is minimized while applying a constraint on the vortex core position, using Lagrange's method of undetermined multipliers. The undetermined multiplier is seen to be the external field needed to hold the vortex core in place at a desired radial distance r from the dot center. This auxiliary field is applied only in the core region of the vortex. For a uniform nanodot, the potential energy is found to be very close to parabolic with r , as in the rigid vortex approximation, while the constraining field increases linearly with r . Effects of nonmagnetic impurities and holes in the medium can also be estimated. An impurity or hole in the dot can lead to bistable operation between the two minima that result under the application of a transverse applied magnetic field.}

The unfolding of the generated complex photonic lattice structures with higher order helical phase is realized by perturbing the superposition of a relatively phase-encoded, axially equidistant multiple of three noncoplanar plane waves. Through a programmable spatial light modulator assisted single step fabrication approach, the unfolded 3D vortex lattice structures are experimentally realized, well matched to our computer simulations. The formation of higher order intertwined helices embedded in these 3D spiraling vortex lattice structures by the superposition of the multiples of phase-engineered three-plane waves interference is also studied.},

  abstract = {A new category of optical microring resonator, which is analogous to the M\textbackslash "obius strip, is proposed. The "M\textbackslash "obius" microring resonator allows the conversion between modes with different polarizations in the ring and light must circulate two cycles to be converted back to the original polarization status, which is similar to a M\textbackslash "obius strip. This topology structure of polarization leads to the free spectral range be half of that corresponds to the cavity round trip. The eigenmodes of this microring are hybridizations of different polarizations and the breaking of the rotation invariance of the ring makes the transmission be related with the polarization of input light. Our work opens the door towards the photonic devices with nontrivial mode topology and provides a novel way to engineering photonic structures for fundamental studies.},

The left-right symmetry of the DW dynamics is broken, yielding markedly different DW mobilities for opposite propagation directions. This asymmetry arises from the tubular geometry and its impact on the DW structure. Also, the Walker breakdown field and velocity are found to be asymmetric for opposite directions. In certain cases, the breakdown can even be suppressed in one or both directions. Topological constraint requires a vortex-antivortex pair mediated breakdown, contrary to the single (anti)vortex in flat strips. This results in a higher breakdown velocity. \textcopyright{} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

We consider nanoparticles of different shapes with cubic or uniaxial core anisotropy and N\cyrchar\CYRG\textcopyright el surface anisotropy. We demonstrate that at low temperatures surface effects can be dominant, leading to an overall cubic effective anisotropy even in spherical nanoparticles with uniaxial core anisotropy. This cubic anisotropy contribution decreases more rapidly with increasing temperature than the uniaxial core anisotropy, leading to a temperature-induced reorientation transition. We discuss the scaling behaviour of the effective anisotropy with magnetization in nanoparticles with surface anisotropy contribution. The scaling exponent deviates from that expected from Callen\cyrchar\cyrv\cyrchar\CYRDJE ``Callen theory due to increased fluctuations of the surface spins.}

  abstract = {A number of proposed next-generation electronic devices, including novel memory elements and versatile transistor circuits, rely on spin currents, that is, the flow of electron angular momentum. A spin current may interact with a magnetic nanostructure and give rise to spin-dependent transport phenomena, or excite magnetization dynamics. In contrast to a spin-polarized charge current, a pure spin current does not produce any charge-related spurious effects. One way to produce a pure spin current is non-local electrical-spin injection, but this approach has suffered so far from low injection efficiency. Here, we demonstrate a significant enhancement of the non-local injection efficiency in a lateral spin valve prepared with an entirely in situ fabrication process. Improvements to the interface quality and the device structure lead to an increase of the spin-signal amplitude by an order of magnitude. The generated pure spin current enables the magnetization reversal of a nanomagnet with the same efficiency as in the case of using charge currents. These results are important for further theoretical developments in multi-terminal structures, but also with a view towards realizing novel devices driven by pure spin currents.}

  abstract = {Any two equivalent discrete curves must have the same invariants at the corresponding points under an affine transformation. In this paper, we construct the moving frame and invariants for the discrete centroaffine curves, which could be used to discriminate the same discrete curves from different graphics, and estimate whether a polygon flow is stable or periodically stable. In fact, using the similar method as the Frenet-Serret frame, a discrete curve can be uniquely identified by its centroaffine curvatures and torsions. In 1878, Darboux studied the problem of midpoint iteration of polygons[12]. Berlekamp et al studied this problem in detail[2]. Now, through the centroaffine curvatures and torsions, the iteration process can be clearly quantified. Exactly, we describe the whole iteration process by using centroaffine curvatures and torsions, and its periodicity could be directly exhibited. As an application, we would obtain some stable discrete space curves with changeless curvatures and torsions after multistep iteration. For the pentagram map of a polygon, the affinely regular polygons are stable. Furthermore, we find the convex hexagons with parallel and equi-length opposite sides are periodically stable, and some convex parallel and equi-length opposite sides octagons are also periodically stable. The proofs of these results are obtained using the structure equations of the discrete cnetroaffine curves and the integrable conditions of its flows.},

Based on the modified Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation with both Slonczewski spin-transfer torque and the field-like torque, we derive an optimal temporally and spatially varying spin current pattern for fast DW propagation along nanowires. Under such conditions, the DW velocity in biaxial wires can be enhanced as much as tens of times higher than that achieved in experiments so far. Moreover, the fast variation of spin polarization can efficiently help DW depinning. Possible experimental realizations are discussed.}

Being driven by the gradient of the curvature of a biaxial stripe, transversal domain walls acquire remarkably high velocities of up to 100 m/s and do not exhibit any Walker-type speed limit. We pinpoint that the inhomogeneous distribution of the curvature-induced Dzyaloshinskii\textendash Moriya interaction is a driving force for the motion of a domain wall. Although we showcase our approach on the specific Euler spiral geometry, the approach is general and can be applied to a wide class of geometries.},

Analytical calculations and finite element modeling of the mechanics quantitatively capture the key behaviors during fabrication/assembly, mounting and use. The results provide design guidelines that highlight the importance of the NM geometry in achieving the required mechanical properties.

  abstract = {Flexible ferromagnetic rings are spin-chain magnets, in which the magnetic and mechanical subsystems are coupled. The coupling is achieved through the tangentially oriented anisotropy axis. The possibility to operate the mechanics of the nanomagnets by controlling their magnetization is an important issue for the nanorobotics applications. A minimal model for the deformable curved anisotropic Heisenberg ferromagnetic wire is proposed. An equilibrium phase diagram is constructed for the closed loop geometry: (i) A vortex state with vanishing total magnetic moment is typical for relatively large systems; in this case the wire has the form of a regular circle. (ii) A topologically trivial onion state with the planar magnetization distribution is realized in small enough systems; magnetic loop is elliptically deformed. By varying geometrical and elastic parameters a phase transition between the vortex and onion states takes place. The detailed analytical description of the phase diagram is well confirmed by numerical simulations.},

New types of magnetization distributions such as the edge domains structure and out-of-plane domains patterned vortex and leaf were found in semi-infinite films and nanodisks, respectively.},

  abstract = {Abstract Elementary spin excitations (magnons) play a fundamental role in condensed matter physics, since many phenomena e.g. magnetic ordering, electrical (as well as heat) transport properties, ultrafast magnetization processes, and most importantly electron/spin dynamics can only be understood when these quasi-particles are taken into consideration. In addition to their fundamental importance, magnons may also be used for information processing in modern spintronics. Here the concept of spin excitations in ultrathin itinerant magnets is discussed and reviewed. Starting with a historical introduction, different classes of magnons are introduced. Different theoretical treatments of spin excitations in solids are outlined. Interaction of spin-polarized electrons with a magnetic surface is discussed. It is shown that, based on the quantum mechanical conservation rules, a magnon can only be excited when a minority electron is injected into the system. While the magnon creation process is forbidden by majority electrons, the magnon annihilation process is allowed instead. These fundamental quantum mechanical selection rules, together with the strong interaction of electrons with matter, make the spin-polarized electron spectroscopies as appropriate tools to excite and probe the elementary spin excitations in low-dimensional magnets e.g ultrathin films and nanostructures. The focus is put on the experimental results obtained by spin-polarized electron energy loss spectroscopy and spin-polarized inelastic tunneling spectroscopy. The magnon dispersion relation, lifetime, group and phase velocity measured using these approaches in various ultrathin magnets are discussed in detail. The differences and similarities with respect to the bulk excitations are addressed. The role of the temperature, atomic structure, number of atomic layers, lattice strain, electronic complexes and hybridization at the interfaces are outlined. A possibility of simultaneous probing of magnons and phonons in complex low-dimensional ferromagnetic oxide nanostructures is discussed. The influence of the relativistic spin\textendash orbit coupling on high-energy magnons is addressed. It is shown how the spin\textendash orbit coupling breaks the energy degeneracy of the magnons excited in an ultrathin ferromagnet, and how it influences their lifetime, amplitude, group and phase velocity. A potential application of these new effects in modern spintronics is outlined. It is illustrated how one can take advantage of collective nature of magnons and use these quasi-particles for probing the magnetic exchange interaction at buried interfaces.},

  abstract = {The nonlinear stage of the parametric excitation of spin waves in ferromagnetic dielectrics is reviewed. The main nonlinear mechanism which limits the amplitude of the exponentially growing waves is the "pairing" of waves with equal and opposite wave vectors, which leads to the violation of phase relationships. This effect is described in terms of a Hamiltonian which is diagonal in the wave pairs; The corresponding approximation is called the S theory. Within the framework of this theory, the distribution of the excited waves in {$\kappa$} space is singular: the waves lie on individual lines or points. Consequences of the S theory and their experimental verification are discussed in detail. Collective oscillations of a spin-wave system and the origin of the observed self-modulation of their amplitude are also considered.}

  abstract = {Graphics processing unit (GPU) has obtained great success in scientific computations for its tremendous computational horsepower and very high memory bandwidth. This paper discusses the efficient way to implement polynomial preconditioned conjugate gradient solver for the finite element computation of elasticity on NVIDIA GPUs using compute unified device architecture (CUDA). Sliced block ELLPACK (SBELL) format is introduced to store sparse matrix arising from finite element discretization of elasticity with fewer padding zeros than traditional ELLPACK-based formats. Polynomial preconditioning methods have been investigated both in convergence and running time. From the overall performance, the least-squares (L-S) polynomial method is chosen as a preconditioner in PCG solver to finite element equations derived from elasticity for its best results on different example meshes. In the PCG solver, mixed precision algorithm is used not only to reduce the overall computational, storage requirements and bandwidth but to make full use of the capacity of the GPU devices. With SBELL format and mixed precision algorithm, the GPU-based L-S preconditioned CG can get a speedup of about 7\textendash 9 to CPU-implementation.},

  abstract = {We present a simple model of a domain wall in a thin-film ferromagnet. A domain wall is represented as a nonreciprocal string, on which transverse waves propagate with different speeds in opposite directions. The model has three parameters: mass density, tension, and a gyroscopic constant quantifying the nonreciprocity. We discuss the unusual dynamics of a nonreciprocal string in a strip of constant width.},

We explore by density-functional theory calculations the possibility to modify the magnetic properties at Co/Pt interfaces with chemical disorder. In these systems, we find a particular robustness of the DMI against intermixing. Upon dusting the interface with a third element (all \$4d\$ transition metals and B, Cu, Au and Bi), a strong reduction of the DMI is predicted. This opens up possibilities to tune the DMI through the degrees of intermixing and dusting.},

Anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) measurements and scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) are used to investigate their magnetic ground states and its stability. We find that the magnetization in zero applied magnetic field is in a very stable vortex state. Its origin is attributed to a strong growth-induced anisotropy with easy axis perpendicular to the long axis of the tubes. AMR measurements of individual NTs in combination with micromagnetic simulations allow the determination of the magnitude of the growth-induced anisotropy for different types of NT coatings. We show that the strength of the anisotropy can be controlled by introducing a buffer layer underneath the magnetic layer. The magnetic ground states depend on the external magnetic field history and are directly imaged using STXM. Stable vortex domains can be introduced by external magnetic fields and can be erased by radio-frequency magnetic fields applied at the center of the tubes via a strip line antenna.},

For energy functionals defined spatially, our method can be used to describe the magnon dispersion.

To find the equilibrium states of the magnetization, we suggest a trajectory-dependent solver, which allows for fast fitting of experimental ferromagnetic resonance spectra.},

  abstract = {A three-dimensional computer simulation of dynamic processes occurring in a domain wall moving in a soft-magnetic uniaxial film with in-plane anisotropy has been performed based on the micromagnetic approach. It has been shown that the domain wall motion is accompanied by topological transformations of the magnetization distribution, or, more specifically, by ``fast'' processes associated with the creation and annihilation of vortices, antivortices, and singular (Bloch) points. The method used for visualizing the topological structure of magnetization distributions is based on the numerical determination of topological charges of two types by means of the integration over the contours and surfaces with variable geometry. The obtained data indicate that the choice of the initial configuration predetermines the dynamic scenario of topological transformations.}
