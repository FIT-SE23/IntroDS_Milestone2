  Abstract                 = {We propose a minimal model of predator-swarm interactions which captures many of the essential dynamics observed in nature. Different outcomes are observed depending on the predator strength. For a 'weak' predator, the swarm is able to escape the predator completely. As the strength is increased, the predator is able to catch up with the swarm as a whole, but the individual prey is able to escape by 'confusing' the predator: the prey forms a ring with the predator at the centre. For higher predator strength, complex chasing dynamics are observed which can become chaotic. For even higher strength, the predator is able to successfully capture the prey. Our model is simple enough to be amenable to a full mathematical analysis, which is used to predict the shape of the swarm as well as the resulting predator-prey dynamics as a function of model parameters. We show that, as the predator strength is increased, there is a transition (owing to a Hopf bifurcation) from confusion state to chasing dynamics, and we compute the threshold analytically. Our analysis indicates that the swarming behaviour is not helpful in avoiding the predator, suggesting that there are other reasons why the species may swarm. The complex shape of the swarm in our model during the chasing dynamics is similar to the shape of a flock of sheep avoiding a shepherd.},

  abstract  = {Chemically active particles suspended in a liquid
	  solution can achieve self-motility by locally changing the chemical
	  composition of the solution via catalytic reactions at their
	  surfaces. They operate intrinsically out of equilibrium,
	  continuously extracting free energy from the environment to power
	  the dissipative self-motility. The effective interactions involving
	  active particles are, in general, nonreciprocal and anisotropic,
	  even if the particles have simple shapes (e.g., Janus spheres).
	  Accordingly, for chemically active particles a very rich behavior
	  of collective motion and self-assembly may be expected to emerge,
	  including phenomena such as microphase separation in the form of
	  kinetically stable, finite-sized aggregates. Here, I succinctly
	  review a number of recent experimental studies that demonstrate the
	  self-assembly of structures, involving chemically active Janus
	  particles, which exhibit various patterns of motion. These examples
	  illustrate concepts such as "motors made out of motors" (as
	  suggestively named by Fischer [Fischer, P. Nat. Phys. 2018, 14,
	  1072]). The dynamics of assembly and structure formation observed
	  in these systems can provide benchmark, in-depth testing of the
	  current understanding of motion and effective interactions produced
	  by chemical activity. Finally, one notes that these significant
	  achievements are likely just the beginning of the field. Recently
	  reported particles endowed with time-dependent chemical activity or
	  switchable reaction mechanisms open the way for exciting
	  developments, such as periodic reshaping of self-assembled
	  structures based on man-made internal clocks.},

We derive an effective Cahn-Hilliard equation on large length and time scales, which implies that the separation process can be mapped onto that of passive particles. A lower density threshold for clustering is found, and using our approach we demonstrate that clustering first proceeds via a hysteretic nucleation scenario and above a higher threshold changes into a spinodal-like instability. Our results are in agreement with particle-resolved computer simulations and can be verified in experiments of artificial or biological microswimmers.},

  volume    = {33},
  abstract  = {We consider the Cahn-Hilliard (CH) equation with a Burgers-type convective term that is used as a model of coarsening dynamics in laterally driven phase-separating systems. In the absence of driving, it is known that solutions to the standard CH equation are characterized by an initial stage of phase separation into regions of one phase surrounded by the other phase (i.e., clusters or drops/holes or islands are obtained) followed by the coarsening process, where the average size of the structures grows in time and their number decreases. Moreover, two main coarsening modes have been identified in the literature, namely, coarsening due to volume transfer and due to translation. In the opposite limit of strong driving, the well-known Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation is recovered, which may produce complicated chaotic spatio-temporal oscillations. The primary aim of the present work is to perform a detailed and systematic investigation of the transitions in the solutions of the convective CH (cCH) equation for a wide range of parameter values, and, in particular, to understand in detail how the coarsening dynamics is affected by an increase of the strength of the lateral driving force. Considering symmetric two-drop states, we find that one of the coarsening modes is stabilized at relatively weak driving, and the type of the remaining mode may change as driving increases. Furthermore, there exist intervals in the driving strength where coarsening is completely stabilized. In the intervals where the symmetric two-drop states are unstable they can evolve, for example, into one-drop states, two-drop states of broken symmetry or even time-periodic two-drop states that consist of two traveling drops that periodically exchange mass. We present detailed stability diagrams for symmetric two-drop states in various parameter planes and corroborate our findings by selected time simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {We characterize the coarsening dynamics associated with a convective Cahn-Hilliard equation (cCH) in one space dimension. First, we derive a sharp-interface theory through a matched asymptotic analysis. Two types of phase boundaries (kink and anti-kink) arise, due to the presence of convection, and their motions are governed to leading order by a nearest-neighbors interaction coarsening dynamical system (CDS). Theoretical predictions on CDS include: The characteristic length L-M for coarsening exhibits the temporal power law scaling t(1/2); provided L-M is appropriately small with respect to the Peclet length scale L-p. Binary coalescence of phase boundaries is impossible. " Ternary coalescence only occurs through the kink-ternary interaction; two kinks meet an anti-kink resulting in a kink. Direct numerical simulations performed on both CDS and cCH confirm each of these predictions. A linear stability analysis of CDS identifies a pinching mechanism as the dominant instability, which in turn leads to kink-ternaries. We propose a self-similar period-doubling pinch ansatz as a model for the coarsening process, from which an analytical coarsening law for the characteristic length scale L-M emerges. It predicts both the scaling constant c of the t(1/2) regime, i.e. L-M = ct(1/2), as well as the crossover to logarithmically slow coarsening as LM crosses L-P. Our analytical coarsening law stands in good qualitative agreement with large-scale numerical simulations that have been performed on cCH. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science.},

It provides a simple microscopic description of the thermodynamic transition between liquid and crystalline states. In addition to spatially extended periodic structures, the model describes a large variety of steady spatially localized structures. In appropriate bifurcation diagrams the corresponding solution branches exhibit characteristic slanted homoclinic snaking. In an active PFC model, encoding for instance the active motion of self-propelled colloidal particles, the gradient dynamics structure is broken by a coupling between density and an additional polarization field. Then, resting and traveling localized states are found with transitions characterized by parity-breaking drift bifurcations. Here, we briefly review the snaking behavior of localized states in passive and active PFC models before discussing the bifurcation behavior of localized states in systems of (i) two coupled passive PFC models with common gradient dynamics, (ii) two coupled passive PFC models where the coupling breaks the gradient dynamics structure and (iii) a passive PFC model coupled to an active PFC model.},

Already a linear stability analysis of the homogeneous mixed state shows that activity not only allows for the usual large-scale stationary (Cahn-Hilliard) instability of the well-known passive case but also for small-scale stationary (Turing) and large-scale oscillatory (Hopf) instabilities. In consequence of the Turing instability, activity may completely suppress the usual coarsening dynamics. In a fully nonlinear analysis, we first briefly discuss the passive case before focusing on the active case. Bifurcation diagrams and selected direct time simulations are presented that allow us to establish that nonvariational coupling (i) can partially or completely suppress coarsening and (ii) may lead to the emergence of drifting and oscillatory states.

  abstract  = {The classical Cahn–Hilliard (CH) equation corresponds to a gradient dynamics model that describes phase decomposition in a binary mixture. In the spinodal region, an initially homogeneous state spontaneously decomposes via a large-scale instability into drop, hole or labyrinthine concentration patterns of a typical structure length followed by a continuously ongoing coarsening process. Here, we consider the coupled CH dynamics of two concentration fields and show that non-reciprocal (or active or non-variational) coupling may induce a small-scale (Turing) instability. At the corresponding primary bifurcation, a branch of periodically patterned steady states emerges. Furthermore, there exist localized states that consist of patterned patches coexisting with a homogeneous background. The branches of steady parity-symmetric and parity-asymmetric localized states form a slanted homoclinic snaking structure typical for systems with a conservation law. In contrast to snaking structures in systems with gradient dynamics, here, Hopf instabilities occur at a sufficiently large activity, which results in oscillating and travelling localized patterns.},

The PFC method operates on atomic length and diffusive time scales, and thus constitutes a computationally efficient alternative to molecular simulation methods. Its intense development in materials science started fairly recently following the work by Elder et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 88 (2002), p. 245701]. Since these initial studies, dynamical density functional theory and thermodynamic concepts have been linked to the PFC approach to serve as further theoretical fundamentals for the latter. In this review, we summarize these methodological development steps as well as the most important applications of the PFC method with a special focus on the interaction of development steps taken in hard and soft matter physics, respectively. Doing so, we hope to present today's state of the art in PFC modelling as well as the potential, which might still arise from this method in physics and materials science in the nearby future.},

bifurcation, the usual Ginzburg?Landau equation for the amplitude of the pattern is then coupled to
an equation for the large-scale mode. These amplitude equations show that for certain parameters
all roll-type solutions are unstable. This new instability differs from the Eckhaus instability in
that it is amplitude-driven and is supercritical. Beyond the stability boundary, there exist stable
stationary solutions in the form of strongly modulated patterns. The envelope of these modulations
is calculated in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions and, away from the onset of modulation, is
closely approximated by a sech profile. Numerical simulations indicate that as the modulation
becomes more pronounced, the envelope broadens. A number of applications are considered,
including convection with fixed-flux boundaries and convection in a magnetic field, resulting in
new instabilities for these systems.},

  pages    = {851--1112},
  abstract = {A comprehensive review of spatiotemporal pattern formation in systems driven away from equilibrium is presented, with emphasis on comparisons between theory and quantitative experiments. Examples include patterns in hydrodynamic systems such as thermal convection in pure fluids and binary mixtures, Taylor-Couette flow, parametric-wave instabilities, as well as patterns in solidification fronts, nonlinear optics, oscillatory chemical reactions and excitable biological media. The theoretical starting point is usually a set of deterministic equations of motion, typically in the form of nonlinear partial differential equations. These are sometimes supplemented by stochastic terms representing thermal or instrumental noise, but for macroscopic systems and carefully designed experiments the stochastic forces are often negligible. An aim of theory is to describe solutions of the deterministic equations that are likely to be reached starting from typical initial conditions and to persist at long times. A unified description is developed, based on the linear instabilities of a homogeneous state, which leads naturally to a classification of patterns in terms of the characteristic wave vector q0 and frequency omega 0 of the instability. Type Is systems ( omega 0=0, q0 not=0) are stationary in time and periodic in space; type IIIo systems ( omega 0 not=0, q0=0) are periodic in time and uniform in space; and type Io systems ( omega 0 not=0, q0 not=0) are periodic in both space and time. Near a continuous (or supercritical) instability, the dynamics may be accurately described via 'amplitude equations,' whose form is universal for each type of instability. The specifics of each system enter only through the nonuniversal coefficients. Far from the instability threshold a different universal description known as the 'phase equation' may be derived, but it is restricted to slow distortions of an ideal pattern. For many systems appropriate starting equations are either not known or too complicated to analyze conveniently. It is thus useful to introduce phenomenological order-parameter models, which lead to the correct amplitude equations near threshold, and which may be solved analytically or numerically in the nonlinear regime away from the instability. The above theoretical methods are useful in analyzing 'real pattern effects' such as the influence of external boundaries, or the formation and dynamics of defects in ideal structures. An important element in nonequilibrium systems is the appearance of deterministic chaos. A great deal is known about systems with a small number of degrees of freedom displaying 'temporal chaos,' where the structure of the phase space can be analyzed in detail. For spatially extended systems with many degrees of freedom, on the other hand, one is dealing with spatiotemporal chaos and appropriate methods of analysis need to be developed. In addition to the general features of nonequilibrium pattern formation discussed above, detailed reviews of theoretical and experimental work on many specific systems are presented. These include Rayleigh-Benard convection in a pure fluid, convection in binary-fluid mixtures, electrohydrodynamic convection in nematic liquid crystals, Taylor-Couette flow between rotating cylinders, parametric surface waves, patterns in certain open flow systems, oscillatory chemical reactions, static and dynamic patterns in biological media, crystallization fronts, and patterns in nonlinear optics. A concluding section summarizes what has and has not been accomplished, and attempts to assess the prospects for the future.},

  Abstract                 = {Pattern formation often occurs in spatially extended physical, biological, and chemical systems due to an instability of the homogeneous steady state. The type of the instability usually prescribes the resulting spatio-temporal patterns and their characteristic length scales. However, patterns resulting from the simultaneous occurrence of instabilities cannot be expected to be simple superposition of the patterns associated with the considered instabilities. To address this issue, we design two simple models composed by two asymmetrically coupled equations of non-conserved (Swift-Hohenberg equations) or conserved (Cahn-Hilliard equations) order parameters with different characteristic wave lengths. The patterns arising in these systems range from coexisting static patterns of different wavelengths to traveling waves. A linear stability analysis allows to derive a two parameter phase diagram for the studied models, in particular, revealing for the Swift-Hohenberg equations, a co-dimension two bifurcation point of Turing and wave instability and a region of coexistence of stationary and traveling patterns. The nonlinear dynamics of the coupled evolution equations is investigated by performing accurate numerical simulations. These reveal more complex patterns, ranging from traveling waves with embedded Turing patterns domains to spatio-temporal chaos, and a wide hysteretic region, where waves or Turing patterns coexist. For the coupled Cahn-Hilliard equations the presence of a weak coupling is sufficient to arrest the coarsening process and to lead to the emergence of purely periodic patterns. The final states are characterized by domains with a characteristic length, which diverges logarithmically with the coupling amplitude. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

  Abstract                 = {Emulsions consisting of droplets immersed in a fluid
	  are typically unstable since they coarsen over time. One important
	  coarsening process is Ostwald ripening, which is driven by the
	  surface tension of the droplets. Stability of emulsions is relevant
	  not only in complex fluids but also in biological cells, which
	  contain liquidlike compartments, e.g., germ granules, Cajal bodies,
	  and centrosomes. Such cellular systems are driven away from
	  equilibrium, e.g., by chemical reactions, and thus can be called
	  active emulsions. In this paper, we study such active emulsions by
	  developing a coarse-grained description of the droplet dynamics,
	  which we analyze for two different chemical reaction schemes. We
	  first consider the simple case of first-order reactions, which
	  leads to stable, monodisperse emulsions in which Ostwald ripening
	  is suppressed within a range of chemical reaction rates. We then
	  consider autocatalytic droplets, which catalyze the production of
	  their own droplet material. Spontaneous nucleation of autocatalytic
	  droplets is strongly suppressed and their emulsions are typically
	  unstable. We show that autocatalytic droplets can be nucleated
	  reliably and their emulsions stabilized by the help of chemically
	  active cores, which catalyze the production of droplet material. In
	  summary, different reaction schemes and catalytic cores can be used
	  to stabilize emulsions and to control their properties.},

  abstract = {In this work we identify and investigate a novel bifurcation in conserved systems. This secondary bifurcation stops active phase separation in its nonlinear regime. It is then either replaced by an extended, system-filling, spatially periodic pattern or, in a complementary parameter region, by a novel hybrid state with spatially alternating homogeneous and periodic states. The transition from phase separation to extended spatially periodic patterns is hysteretic. We show that the resulting patterns are multistable, as they show stability beyond the bifurcation for different wavenumbers belonging to a wavenumber band. The transition from active phase separation to the hybrid states is continuous. Both transition scenarios are systems-spanning phenomena in particle conserving systems. They are predicted with a generic dissipative model introduced in this work. Candidates for specific systems, in which these generic secondary transitions are likely to occur, are, for example, generalized models for motility-induced phase separation in active Brownian particles, models for cell division or chemotactic systems with conserved particle dynamics.},

	abstract = {Materials undergoing both phase separation and chemical reactions (defined here as all processes that change particle type or number) form an important class of non-equilibrium systems. Examples range from suspensions of self-propelled bacteria with birth–death dynamics, to bio-molecular condensates, or ‘membraneless organelles’, within cells. In contrast to their passive counterparts, such systems have conserved and non-conserved dynamics that do not, in general, derive from a shared free energy. This mismatch breaks time-reversal symmetry and leads to new types of dynamical competition that are absent in or near equilibrium. We construct a canonical scalar field theory to describe such systems, with conserved and non-conserved dynamics obeying model B and model A, respectively (in the Hohenberg–Halperin classification), chosen such that the two free energies involved are incompatible. The resulting minimal model is shown to capture the various phenomenologies reported previously for more complicated models with the same physical ingredients, including microphase separation, limit cycles and droplet splitting. We find a low-dimensional subspace of parameters for which time-reversal symmetry is accidentally recovered, and show that here the dynamics of the order parameter field (but not its conserved current) is exactly the same as an equilibrium system in which microphase separation is caused by long-range attractive interactions.}
