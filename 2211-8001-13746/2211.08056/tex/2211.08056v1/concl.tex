\section{Conclusion}
Cloud workloads have shifted towards deploying small functional units heavily
communicating within a single machine or across a set of machines leading to an
unsustainable infrastructure tax of about 25\%. In this paper, we hypothesize a
\arch to reduce these overheads and generalize the environment to a larger set
of applications. We argue that existing languages and runtimes provide
sufficient security guarantees to implement a \archshort and take advantage of
the benefits of memory-safe languages and runtimes for these workloads. We
highlight open research questions and potential optimizations to further improve
the architecture.
