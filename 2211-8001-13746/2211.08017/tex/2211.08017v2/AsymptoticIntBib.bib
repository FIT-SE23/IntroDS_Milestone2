This chapter examines the distribution of magnetic moments in a ferromagnetic crystal. When the crystal is magnetized, the boundaries between the oppositely magnetized layers move so that the layers with one direction of magnetic moment grow at the cost of the layers with moments in the opposite direction. The presence of separate elementary regions, magnetized in opposite directions, is due only to the demagnetizing effect of the surface, and the number and dimensions of these regions are entirely determined by the dimensions of the body. The analysis of the preceding section gives only the distribution of the directions of the magnetic moments in the intermediate regions but gives nothing for determining the width of the layers. If the crystal is placed in an external magnetic field, which is directed parallel to the axis of easiest magnetization, the boundaries between the layers begin to move so that the layers with magnetic moments parallel to the field become wider.}

    abstract = { Magnets without inversion symmetry are a prime example of a solid-state system featuring topological solitons on the nanoscale, and a promising candidate for novel spintronic applications. Magnetic chiral skyrmions are localized vortex-like structures, which are stabilized by antisymmetric exchange interaction, the so-called Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction. In continuum theories, the corresponding energy contribution is, in contrast to the classical Skyrme mechanism from nuclear physics, of linear gradient dependence and breaks the chiral symmetry. In the simplest possible case of a ferromagnetic energy in the plane, including symmetric and antisymmetric exchange and Zeeman interaction, we show that the least energy in a class of fields with unit topological charge is attained provided the Zeeman field is sufficiently large. }

abstractNote = {Reconfigurable, ordered matter offers great potential for future low-power computer memory by storing information in energetically stable configurations. Among these, skyrmions—which are topologically protected, robust excitations that have been demonstrated in chiral magnets1,2,3,4 and in liquid crystals5,6,7—are driving much excitement about potential spintronic applications8. These information-encoding structures topologically resemble field configurations in many other branches of physics and have a rich history9, although chiral condensed-matter systems so far have yielded realizations only of elementary full and fractional skyrmions. Here we describe stable, high-degree multi-skyrmion configurations where an arbitrary number of antiskyrmions are contained within a larger skyrmion. We call these structures skyrmion bags. We demonstrate them experimentally and numerically in liquid crystals and numerically in micromagnetic simulations either without or with magnetostatic effects. We find that skyrmion bags act like single skyrmions in pairwise interaction and under the influence of current in magnetic materials, and are thus an exciting proposition for topological magnetic storage and logic devices.},

We inquire into the formulation of an asymptotic “particle + field” defect dynamics which derives from the full PDE. We carry out this program for two complex scalar field equations in two space dimensions, the nonlinear Schrödinger equation and the nonlinear heat equation. The topological defects are zeros of the complex scalar field with nonzero integer winding numbers, called vortices. Vortices evolving under the nonlinear Schrödinger equation behave like point vortices in ideal fluid. Pairs of vortices evolving under the nonlinear heat equation with like (opposite) winding numbers undergo a repulsive (attractive) interaction."

A phase diagram in these variables consists of three thermodynamically stable phases: a uniform state at high field values, a one-dimensionally modulated spiral state at low fields and the new vortex state in an intermediate field range. The corresponding calculated magnetization curves clearly show the transitions between these states.}

One uses a relativised product ansatz for the Skyrme fields, the other models Skyrmions as triplets of scalar dipoles. The methods lead to the same finite-dimensional Lagrangian dynamical system which may be interpreted as a point-particle approximation to Skyrmion dynamics. We discuss in detail the dynamics in the so-called attractive channel and the interaction between well-separated and rapidly spinning Skyrmions, and point out the resemblance between the latter and the one-pion exchange potential in nuclear physics.",

The way in which a non-linear meson field theory of this type may contain its own sources, and how these may be idealised to point singularities, as in the conventional field theories of interacting linear systems, is formulated. The structure of the particle source in the classical theory is calculated, and some qualitative features of the interactions between these particles and mesons are described.}

abstract = {Two-dimensional localized states in the form of isolated vortices are studied systematically in uniaxial ferromagnets with an antisymmetric `Dzyaloshinsky’ exchange interaction. In addition to previously investigated π-vortices, new types of localized solutions were found. Their structure and equilibrium parameters were calculated by numerically solving the differential equations. We studied the stability of all solutions with respect to small radial distortions by solving the eigenvalue problem for the perturbation energy. It turned out that single vortices as well as multiple vortices with a magnetization rotation kπ(k=2,3,…) are stable in certain parameter regions, while other solutions of the differential equations such as vortices with nodes and large or blown-up vortices are always radially unstable. The stability analysis also answered the question of the decay modes of the stable solutions at their stability limits.}
