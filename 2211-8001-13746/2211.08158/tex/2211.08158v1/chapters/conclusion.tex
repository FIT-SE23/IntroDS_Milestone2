\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we extend the idea of SynGEC \cite{zhang2022syngec} and propose the CSynGEC approach to enhance GEC models by exploiting tailored constituent-based syntax. Experimental results show that incorporating constituent-based syntax produced by a GEC-oriented constituency parser can effectively help GEC models. 
Furthermore, we attempt to combine dependency-based and constituent-based syntax from both intra-model and inter-model aspects, and find that simultaneously using two kinds of syntax leads to more obvious improvement.
