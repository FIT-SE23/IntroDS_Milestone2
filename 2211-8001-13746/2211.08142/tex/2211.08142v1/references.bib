  abstract = {In spite of soaring tuition costs, more and more students go to college every year. A bachelor's degree is now required for entry into a growing number of professions. And some parents begin planning for the expense of sending their kids to college when they're born. Almost everyone strives to go, but almost no one asks the fundamental question posed by Academically Adrift: are undergraduates really learning anything once they get there?For a large proportion of students, Richard Arum and Josipa Roksa's answer to that question is a definitive no. Their extensive research draws on survey responses, transcript data, and, for the first time, the state-of-the-art Collegiate Learning Assessment, a standardized test administered to students in their first semester and then again at the end of their second year. According to their analysis of more than 2,300 undergraduates at twenty-four institutions, 45 percent of these students demonstrate no significant improvement in a range of skills\textemdash including critical thinking, complex reasoning, and writing\textemdash during their first two years of college. As troubling as their findings are, Arum and Roksa argue that for many faculty and administrators they will come as no surprise\textemdash instead, they are the expected result of a student body distracted by socializing or working and an institutional culture that puts undergraduate learning close to the bottom of the priority list.Academically Adrift holds sobering lessons for students, faculty, administrators, policy makers, and parents\textemdash all of whom are implicated in promoting or at least ignoring contemporary campus culture. Higher education faces crises on a number of fronts, but Arum and Roksa's report that colleges are failing at their most basic mission will demand the attention of us all.},

  abstract = {Representational Learning in the form of high dimensional embeddings have been used for multiple pattern recognition applications. There has been a significant interest in building embedding based systems for learning representations in the mathematical domain. At the same time, retrieval of structured information such as mathematical expressions is an important need for modern IR systems. In this work, our motivation is to introduce a robust framework for learning representations for similarity based retrieval of mathematical expressions. Given a query by example, the embedding can find the closest matching expression as a function of euclidean distance between them. We leverage recent advancements in image-based and graph-based deep learning algorithms to learn our similarity embeddings. We do this first, by using unimodal encoders in graph space and image space and then, a multi-modal combination of the same. To overcome the lack of training data, we force the networks to learn a deep metric using triplets generated with a heuristic scoring function. We also adopt a custom strategy for mining hard samples to train our neural networks. Our system produces rankings similar to those generated by the original scoring function, but using only a fraction of the time. Our results establish the viability of using such a multi-modal embedding for this task.},

As a step in this direction, we propose a new architecture, called neural equivalence network, for the problem of learning continuous semantic representations of algebraic and logical expressions. These networks are trained to represent semantic equivalence, even of expressions that are syntactically very different. The challenge is that semantic representations must be computed in a syntax-directed manner, because semantics is compositional, but at the same time, small changes in syntax can lead to very large changes in semantics, which can be difficult for continuous neural architectures. We perform an exhaustive evaluation on the task of checking equivalence on a highly diverse class of symbolic algebraic and boolean expression types, showing that our model significantly outperforms existing architectures.},

  abstract = {Question Answering (QA) is a specialized area in the field of Information Retrieval (IR). The QA systems are concerned with providing relevant answers in response to questions proposed in natural language. QA is therefore composed of three distinct modules, each of which has a core component beside other supplementary components. These three core components are: question classification, information retrieval, and answer extraction. Question classification plays an essential role in QA systems by classifying the submitted question according to its type. Information retrieval is very important for question answering, because if no correct answers are present in a document, no further processing could be carried out to find an answer. Finally, answer extraction aims to retrieve the answer for a question asked by the user. This survey paper provides an overview of Question-Answering and its system architecture, as well as the previous related work comparing each research against the others with respect to the components that were covered and the approaches that were followed. At the end, the survey provides an analytical discussion of the proposed QA models, along with their main contributions, experimental results, and limitations.},

In this paper, we propose RESPARC - a reconfigurable and energy efficient architecture built-on Memristive Crossbar Arrays (MCA) for deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Prior works were primarily focused on device and circuit implementations of SNNs on crossbars. RESPARC advances this by proposing a complete system for SNN acceleration and its subsequent analysis. RESPARC utilizes the energy-efficiency of MCAs for inner-product computation and realizes a hierarchical reconfigurable design to incorporate the data-flow patterns in an SNN in a scalable fashion. We evaluate the proposed architecture on different SNNs ranging in complexity from 2k-230k neurons and 1.2M-5.5M synapses. Simulation results on these networks show that compared to the baseline digital CMOS architecture, RESPARC achieves 500x (15x) efficiency in energy benefits at 300x (60x) higher throughput for multi-layer perceptrons (deep convolutional networks). Furthermore, RESPARC is a technology-aware architecture that maps a given SNN topology to the most optimized MCA size for the given crossbar technology.},

  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder-decoders and consists of an encoder that encodes a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder-decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

  abstract = {Context Nowadays the concept of knowledge mapping has attracted increased attention from scientists in a variety of academic disciplines and professional practice areas. Among the most important attributes of a knowledge map is its ability to increase communication and share common practices across an entire organisation. However, despite being a promising area for research, the knowledge maps community lacks a widespread understanding of the current state of the art. Objective The objective of this article is to explore the world of knowledge mapping by reviewing and analysing the current state of research and providing an overview of knowledge mapping's concepts, benefits, techniques, classifications and methodologies, which are precisely reviewed, and their features are highlighted. In addition, we offer directions for future research. Method Based on the systematic literature review method this study collects, synthesises, and analyses numerous articles on a variety of topics closely related to a knowledge map published from January 2000 to December 2013 on six electronic databases by following a pre-defined review protocol. The articles have been retrieved through a combination of automatic and manual search, hence extensive quantitative and qualitative results of the research are provided. Results From the review study, we identified 132 articles addressing knowledge maps that have been reviewed in order to extract relevant information on a set of research questions. We found a generally increasing level of activity during this 5-year period. We noted that while existing research covers a large number of studies on some disciplines, such as systems and tools development, it contains very few studies on other disciplines, such as knowledge maps adoption. To aid this situation, we offer directions for future research. Conclusions The results demonstrated that a knowledge map is an imperative strategy for increasing organisations' effectiveness. In addition, there is a need for more knowledge maps research.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}A central goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the \textbf{curse of dimensionality}: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training.

  abstract = {A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.},

Unfortunately, current commercial OCR (optical character recognition) software packages are quite unable to handle mathematical formulas, since their algorithms at all levels use heuristics developed for other document styles. We are concerned with the development of OCR methods that are able to handle this specialized task of mathematical expression recognition.},

Efforts to digitize text, images, video, and audio now consume a substantial portion of both academic and industrial activity. Even when there is no shortage of textual materials on a particular topic, procedures for indexing or extracting the knowledge or conceptual information contained in them can be lacking. Recently developed information retrieval technologies are based on the concept of a vector space. Data are modeled as a matrix, and a user's query of the database is represented as a vector. Relevant documents in the database are then identified via simple vector operations. Orthogonal factorizations of the matrix provide mechanisms for handling uncertainty in the database itself. The purpose of this paper is to show how such fundamental mathematical concepts from linear algebra can be used to manage and index large text collections.},

Conductance in insulating oxides employed in RRAM devices can be strongly affected by atomic-level changes that makes cell switching properties extremely sensitive to operation conditions inducing local structural modifications. This opens an opportunity to condition the memory cell stack by forming a conductive filament capable of high frequency, low energy switching. Certain materials with pre-existing conductive paths, in particular some polycrystalline oxides, like hafnia, are shown to respond well to this approach. For this class of materials, the concept of ultra-fast pulse technique as an ultimate method for assessing RRAM switching capabilities in circuitry operations is discussed. Hafnia-based cells demonstrate compliance-free (1R) forming with no current overshoot, low operation currents, and reduced variability.},

  abstract = {Weight decay (WD) is a traditional regularization technique in deep learning, but despite its ubiquity, its behavior is still an area of active research. Golatkar et al. have recently shown that WD only matters at the start of the training in computer vision, upending traditional wisdom. Loshchilov et al. show that for adaptive optimizers, manually decaying weights can outperform adding an \$l\_2\$ penalty to the loss. This technique has become increasingly popular and is referred to as decoupled WD. The goal of this paper is to investigate these two recent empirical observations. We demonstrate that by applying WD only at the start, the network norm stays small throughout training. This has a regularizing effect as the effective gradient updates become larger. However, traditional generalizations metrics fail to capture this effect of WD, and we show how a simple scale-invariant metric can. We also show how the growth of network weights is heavily influenced by the dataset and its generalization properties. For decoupled WD, we perform experiments in NLP and RL where adaptive optimizers are the norm. We demonstrate that the primary issue that decoupled WD alleviates is the mixing of gradients from the objective function and the \$l\_2\$ penalty in the buffers of Adam (which stores the estimates of the first-order moment). Adaptivity itself is not problematic and decoupled WD ensures that the gradients from the \$l\_2\$ term cannot "drown out" the true objective, facilitating easier hyperparameter tuning.},

This is a limitation, especially for languages with large vocabularies and many rare words. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character n-grams. A vector representation is associated to each character n-gram; words being represented as the sum of these representations. Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data. We evaluate our word representations on nine different languages, both on word similarity and analogy tasks. By comparing to recently proposed morphological word representations, we show that our vectors achieve state-of-the-art performance on these tasks.},

In many cases, the reduction of hyperspectral data to the lower-dimension materials-specific parameters is based on functional fitting, where an approximate form of the fitting function is known, but the parameters of the function need to be determined. However, functional fits of noisy data realized via iterative methods, such as least-square gradient descent, often yield spurious results and are very sensitive to initial guesses. Here, we demonstrate an approach for the reduction of the hyperspectral data using a deep neural network approach. A combined deep neural network/least-square approach is shown to improve the effective signal-to-noise ratio of band-excitation piezoresponse force microscopy by more than an order of magnitude, allowing characterization when very small driving signals are used or when a material's response is weak.},

Here, we present a robust and scalable approach to the segmentation of AFM images based on flexible pre-selected classification criteria. The usage of supervised learning and feature extraction allows us to retain the consideration of specific problem-dependent features (such as types of periodical structures observed in the images and the associated numerical parameters: spacing, orientation, etc.). We highlight the applicability of this approach for the segmentation of molecular resolved AFM images based on the crystal orientation of the observed domains, automated selection of boundaries, and collection of relevant statistics. Overall, we outline a general strategy for machine learning-enabled analysis of nanoscale systems exhibiting periodic order that could be applied to any analytical imaging technique.},

We show that current evaluation measures are not robust to substantially incomplete relevance judgments. A new measure is introduced that is both highly correlated with existing measures when complete judgments are available and more robust to incomplete judgment sets. This finding suggests that substantially larger or dynamic test collections built using current pooling practices should be viable laboratory tools, despite the fact that the relevance information will be incomplete and imperfect.},

One difficulty in handling some classes of documents is the presence of different kinds of textual errors, such as spelling and grammatical errors in email, and character recognition errors in documents that come through OCR. Text categorization must work reliably on all input, and thus must tolerate some level of these kinds of problems. We describe here an N-gram-based approach to text categorization that is tolerant of textual errors. The system is small, fast and robust. This system worked very well for language classification, achieving in one test a 99.8\% correct classification rate on Usenet newsgroup articles written in different languages. The system also worked reasonably well for classifying articles from a number of different computer-oriented newsgroups according to subject, achieving as high as an 80\% correct classification...},

This paper presents efficient and effective packing and analytical placement algorithms for large-scale heterogeneous FPGAs to deal with issues on heterogeneity, datapath regularity, and scalability. Compared to the well-known academic tool VPR, experimental results show that our packing and placement algorithms achieve respective 199.80X and 3.07X speedups with better wirelength, and our overall flow achieves 50\% shorter wirelength, with an 18.30X overall speedup.},

The two species are assumed to be identical except their dispersal strategies: both species disperse by random diffusion and advection along environmental gradients, but one species has stronger biased movement (i.e., advection along the environmental gradients) than the other one. It is shown that at least two scenarios can occur: if only one species has a strong tendency to move upward the environmental gradients, the two species can coexist since one species mainly pursues resources at places of locally most favorable environments while the other relies on resources from other parts of the habitat; if both species have such strong biased movements, it can lead to overcrowding of the whole population at places of locally most favorable environments, which causes the extinction of the species with stronger biased movement. These results provide a new mechanism for the coexistence of competing species, and they also imply that selection is against excessive advection along environmental gradients, and an intermediate biased movement rate may evolve.},

NeuroSim provides flexible interface and a wide variety of design options at the circuit and device level. Therefore, NeuroSim can be used by neural networks (NNs) as a supporting tool to provide circuit-level performance evaluation. With NeuroSim, an integrated framework can be built with hierarchical organization from the device level (synaptic device properties) to the circuit level (array architectures) and then to the algorithm level (NN topology), enabling instruction-accurate evaluation on the learning accuracy as well as the circuit-level performance metrics at the run-time of online learning. Using multilayer perceptron as a case-study algorithm, we investigated the impact of the ``analog'' emerging nonvolatile memory (eNVM)'s ``nonideal'' device properties and benchmarked the tradeoffs between SRAM, digital, and analog eNVM-based architectures for online learning and offline classification.},

In all these tasks TextRank operates in an unsupervised way, without using any training corpus. Our main contribution is the definition of a method that allows to apply TextRank to a graph that includes information generated from a training tagged corpus. We have tested our method with the Part of Speech (POS) tagging task, comparing the results with those obtained with tools specialized in this task. The performance of our system is quite near to these tools, improving the results of two of them when the corpus tagset is big and therefore the tagging task more complicated.},

Graphics are represented using Line-of-Sight (LOS) graphs, with symbols connected only when they can `see' each other along an unobstructed line. Symbol identities may be provided (e.g., in PDF) or taken from Optical Character Recognition applied to images. Graphics are indexed by pairs of symbols that `see' each other using their labels, spatial displacement, and size ratio. Retrieval has two layers: the first matches query symbol pairs in an inverted index, while the second aligns candidates with the query and scores the resulting matches using the identity and relative position of symbols. For PDFs, we also introduce a new tool that quickly extracts characters and their locations. We have applied our model to the NTCIR-12 Wikipedia Formula Browsing Task, and found that the method can locate relevant matches without unification of symbols or using a math expression grammar. In the future, one might index LOS graphs for entire pages and search for text and graphics. Our source code has been made publicly available.},

They found that, over a particular test set, the system could find solutions more successfully than sophisticated packages for symbolic mathematics such as Mathematica run with a long time-out. This is an impressive accomplishment, as far as it goes. However, the system can handle only a quite limited subset of the problems that Mathematica deals with, and the test set has significant built-in biases. Therefore the claim that this outperforms Mathematica on symbolic integration needs to be very much qualified.},

This framework, termed physics-guided neural networks (PGNN), leverages the output of physics-based model simulations along with observational features in a hybrid modeling setup to generate predictions using a neural network architecture. Further, this framework uses physics-based loss functions in the learning objective of neural networks to ensure that the model predictions not only show lower errors on the training set but are also scientifically consistent with the known physics on the unlabeled set. We illustrate the effectiveness of PGNN for the problem of lake temperature modeling, where physical relationships between the temperature, density, and depth of water are used to design a physics-based loss function. By using scientific knowledge to guide the construction and learning of neural networks, we are able to show that the proposed framework ensures better generalizability as well as scientific consistency of results.

  abstract = {In recent work [1], a simplified and highly effective approach to speaker recognition based on the cosine similarity between lowdimensional vectors, termed ivectors, defined in a total variability space was introduced. The total variability space representation is motivated by the popular Joint Factor Analysis (JFA) approach, but does not require the complication of estimating separate speaker and channel spaces and has been shown to be less dependent on score normalization procedures, such as znorm and t-norm. In this paper, we introduce a modification to the cosine similarity that does not require explicit score normalization, relying instead on simple mean and covariance statistics from a collection of impostor speaker ivectors. By avoiding the complication of z- and t-norm, the new approach further allows for application of a new unsupervised speaker adaptation technique to models defined in the ivector space. Experiments are conducted on the core condition of the NIST 2008 corpora, where, with adaptation, the new approach produces an equal error rate (EER) of 4.8\% and min decision cost function (MinDCF) of 2.3\% on all female speaker trials.},

We show that unlike neural OCR techniques using CTCbased models, attention-based approaches can tackle this non-standard OCR task. Our approach outperforms classical mathematical OCR systems by a large margin on in-domain rendered data, and, with pretraining, also performs well on out-of-domain handwritten data. To reduce the inference complexity associated with the attention-based approaches, we introduce a new coarse-to-fine attention layer that selects a support region before applying attention.},

It focuses on the lognormal as a model of the abundances of species and not as a model of the size growth of individual organisms. The chapter examines the lognormal as a theoretical model of population abundance. It describes a different stochastic growth model leading to the lognormal. The model is a stochastic differential equation based on the Gompertz growth equation. The chapter explores three typical modifications of the lognormal. First, ecological data sets often consist of count data. Second, ecological abundance surveys often contain an overly large number of samples with abundances of zero. Third, ecological abundances observed in samples sometimes grew from random numbers of initial propagules in each sample. The lognormal is commonly used in ecology in a purely descriptive role as a model of abundance of a single species present in different samples.},

BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful.

The network has multiple edges with different labels and costs representing the ambiguity of the decision of the relation of character pairs. Then, we output the spanning tree of the network with minimum cost which corresponds to the recognition result of the structure of the mathematical formula, using not only the local costs initially attached to the network but the costs reflecting global structure of the formula. The advantage of this method is that local errors of the recognition are recovered automatically by the total cost of the recognition tree.},

  abstract = {Ferroelectric random access memory (FeRAM) based on conventional ferroelectric perovskites, such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 and SrBi2Ta2O9, has encountered bottlenecks on memory density and cost, because those conventional perovskites suffer from various issues mainly including poor complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatibility and limited scalability. Next-generation cost-efficient, high-density FeRAM shall therefore rely on a material revolution. Since the discovery of ferroelectricity in Si:HfO2 thin films in 2011, HfO2-based materials have aroused widespread interest in the field of FeRAM, because they are CMOS-compatible and can exhibit robust ferroelectricity even when the film thickness is scaled down to below 10 nm. A review on this new class of ferroelectric materials is therefore of great interest. In this paper, the most appealing topics about ferroelectric HfO2-based materials including origins of ferroelectricity, advantageous material properties, and current and potential applications in FeRAM, are briefly reviewed.},

  abstract = {Communication, storage, transmission, and searching of complex material has become increasingly important. Mathematical computing in a distributed environment is also becoming more plausible as libraries and computing facilities are connected with each other and with user facilities. TEX is a wellknown mathematical typesetting language, and from the display perspective it might seem that it could be used for communication between computer systems as well as an intermediate form for the results of OCR (optical character recognition) of mathematical expressions. There are flaws in this reasoning, since exchanging mathematical information requires a system to parse and semantically ``understand'' the TEX, even if it is ``ambiguous'' notationally. A program we developed can handle 43\% of 10,740 TEX formulas in a well-known table of integrals. We expect that a higher success rate can be achieved easily.},

This paper explores how to adapt the state-of-the-art BM25 text ranking method to work well when searching for math together with text. Following the approach proposed for the Tangent math search system, we use symbol layout trees to represent math formulae. We extract features from the symbol layout trees to serve as search terms to be ranked using BM25 and then explore the effects on retrieval performance of various classes of features. Based on the results, we recommend which features can be used effectively in a conventional text-based retrieval engine. We validate our overall approach using a NTCIR-12 math and text benchmark.},

Although many papers with known validity problems are highly cited, no auditing process is currently available to determine whether a citing paper's findings fundamentally depend on invalid or unreliable knowledge. To address this, we introduce a new framework, the keystone framework, designed to identify when and how citing unreliable findings impacts a paper, using argumentation theory and citation context analysis. Through two pilot case studies, we demonstrate how the keystone framework can be applied to knowledge maintenance tasks for digital libraries, including addressing citations of a non-reproducible paper and identifying statements most needing validation in a high-impact paper. We identify roles for librarians, database maintainers, knowledgebase curators, and research software engineers in applying the framework to scientific digitallibraries.},

  abstract = {In this chapter, following on from our discussion of ambiguity (Chapter 4), we will introduce the types which are necessary to disambiguate mathematical language. As noted in \textsection 4.4, the actual inference of types will need to be fused into the parsing process; this will be the subject of the next chapter (Chapter 6). Additionally, in the course of this chapter, we will encounter a number of issues relating to the foundations of mathematics; these issues will be discussed extensively in Chapter 7.There are two major difficulties that arise when one is trying to find the types necessary to describe mathematics.

In this hybrid model, both keyword and structure information of formulae are taken into consideration. In addition, the concept of formula importance within a document is introduced into the model. In order to make the ranking results more reasonable, our system (WikiMir) applies the learning to rank algorithm (RankBoost) to rank the retrieved formulae , and then re-ranks the top-k formulae by the regular expressions matching of the query formula.

  abstract = {In recent years, deep neural networks (DNN) have demonstrated significant business impact in large scale analysis and classification tasks such as speech recognition, visual object detection, pattern extraction, etc. Training of large DNNs, however, is universally considered as time consuming and computationally intensive task that demands datacenter-scale computational resources recruited for many days. Here we propose a concept of resistive processing unit (RPU) devices that can potentially accelerate DNN training by orders of magnitude while using much less power. The proposed RPU device can store and update the weight values locally thus minimizing data movement during training and allowing to fully exploit the locality and the parallelism of the training algorithm. We evaluate the effect of various RPU device features/non-idealities and system parameters on performance in order to derive the device and system level specifications for implementation of an accelerator chip for DNN training in a realistic CMOS-compatible technology. For large DNNs with about 1 billion weights this massively parallel RPU architecture can achieve acceleration factors of 30,000X compared to state-of-the-art microprocessors while providing power efficiency of 84,000 GigaOps/s/W. Problems that currently require days of training on a datacenter-size cluster with thousands of machines can be addressed within hours on a single RPU accelerator. A system consisting of a cluster of RPU accelerators will be able to tackle Big Data problems with trillions of parameters that is impossible to address today like, for example, natural speech recognition and translation between all world languages, real-time analytics on large streams of business and scientific data, integration and analysis of multimodal sensory data flows from a massive number of IoT (Internet of Things) sensors.},

  abstract = {Hardware architectures composed of resistive cross-point device arrays can provide significant power and speed benefits for deep neural network training workloads using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and backpropagation (BP) algorithm. The training accuracy on this imminent analog hardware, however, strongly depends on the switching characteristics of the cross-point elements. One of the key requirements is that these resistive devices must change conductance in a symmetrical fashion when subjected to positive or negative pulse stimuli. Here, we present a new training algorithm, so-called the ``Tiki-Taka'' algorithm, that eliminates this stringent symmetry requirement. We show that device asymmetry introduces an unintentional implicit cost term into the SGD algorithm, whereas in the ``Tiki-Taka'' algorithm a coupled dynamical system simultaneously minimizes the original objective function of the neural network and the unintentional cost term due to device asymmetry in a self-consistent fashion. We tested the validity of this new algorithm on a range of network architectures such as fully connected, convolutional and LSTM networks. Simulation results on these various networks show that the accuracy achieved using the conventional SGD algorithm with symmetric (ideal) device switching characteristics is matched in accuracy achieved using the ``Tiki-Taka'' algorithm with non-symmetric (non-ideal) device switching characteristics. Moreover, all the operations performed on the arrays are still parallel and therefore the implementation cost of this new algorithm on array architectures is minimal; and it maintains the aforementioned power and speed benefits. These algorithmic improvements are crucial to relax the material specification and to realize technologically viable resistive crossbar arrays that outperform digital accelerators for similar training tasks.},

Here we extend the concept of Resistive Processing Unit (RPU) devices to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We show how to map the convolutional layers to fully connected RPU arrays such that the parallelism of the hardware can be fully utilized in all three cycles of the backpropagation algorithm. We find that the noise and bound limitations imposed by the analog nature of the computations performed on the arrays significantly affect the training accuracy of the CNNs. Noise and bound management techniques are presented that mitigate these problems without introducing any additional complexity in the analog circuits and that can be addressed by the digital circuits. In addition, we discuss digitally programmable update management and device variability reduction techniques that can be used selectively for some of the layers in a CNN. We show that a combination of all those techniques enables a successful application of the RPU concept for training CNNs. The techniques discussed here are more general and can be applied beyond CNN architectures and therefore enables applicability of the RPU approach to a large class of neural network architectures.},

In this work, we further extend the RPU concept for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) namely LSTMs. We show that the mapping of recurrent layers is very similar to the mapping of fully connected layers and therefore the RPU concept can potentially provide large acceleration factors for RNNs as well. In addition, we study the effect of various device imperfections and system parameters on training performance. Symmetry of updates becomes even more crucial for RNNs; already a few percent asymmetry results in an increase in the test error compared to the ideal case trained with floating point numbers. Furthermore, the input signal resolution to the device arrays needs to be at least 7 bits for successful training. However, we show that a stochastic rounding scheme can reduce the input signal resolution back to 5 bits. Further, we find that RPU device variations and hardware noise are enough to mitigate overfitting, so that there is less need for using dropout. Here we attempt to study the validity of the RPU approach by simulating large scale networks. For instance, the models studied here are roughly 1500 times larger than the more often studied multilayer perceptron models trained on the MNIST dataset in terms of the total number of multiplication and summation operations performed per epoch.},

The key requirements for the NVM elements are continuous (analog-like) conductance tuning capability and switching symmetry with acceptable noise levels. However, most NVM devices show non-linear and asymmetric switching behaviors. Such non-linear behaviors render separation of signal and noise extremely difficult with conventional characterization techniques. In this study, we establish a practical methodology based on Gaussian process regression to address this issue. The methodology is agnostic to switching mechanisms and applicable to various NVM devices. We show tradeoff between switching symmetry and signal-to-noise ratio for HfO2-based resistive random access memory. Then, we characterize 1000 phase-change memory devices based on Ge2Sb2Te5 and separate total variability into device-to-device variability and inherent randomness from individual devices. These results highlight the usefulness of our methodology to realize ideal NVM devices for neuromorphic computing.},

This is useful for consumers who want to research the sentiment of products before purchase, or companies that want to monitor the public sentiment of their brands. There is no previous research on classifying sentiment of messages on microblogging services like Twitter. We present the results of machine learning algorithms for classifying the sentiment of Twitter messages using distant supervision. Our training data consists of Twitter messages with emoticons, which are used as noisy labels. This type of training data is abundantly available and can be obtained through automated means. We show that machine learning algorithms (Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and SVM) have accuracy above 80\% when trained with emoticon data. This paper also describes the preprocessing steps needed in order to achieve high accuracy. The main contribution of this paper is the idea of using tweets with emoticons for distant supervised learning.},

  abstract = {Several variants of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for recurrent neural networks have been proposed since its inception in 1995. In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful fANOVA framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs (\$\textbackslash approx 15\$ years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.},

  abstract = {General purpose GPU Computing (GPGPU) has taken off in the past few years, with great promises for increased desktop processing power due to the large number of fast computing cores on high-end graphics cards. Many publications have demonstrated phenomenal performance and have reported speedups as much as 1000\texttimes{} over code running on multi-core CPUs. Other studies have claimed that well-tuned CPU code reduces the performance gap significantly. We demonstrate that this important discussion is missing a key aspect, specifically the question of where in the system data resides, and the overhead to move the data to where it will be used, and back again if necessary. We have benchmarked a broad set of GPU kernels on a number of platforms with different GPUs and our results show that when memory transfer times are included, it can easily take between 2 to 50\texttimes{} longer to run a kernel than the GPU processing time alone. Therefore, it is necessary to either include memory transfer overhead when reporting GPU performance, or to explain why this is not relevant for the application in question. We suggest a taxonomy for future CPU/GPU comparisons, and we argue that this is not only germane for reporting performance, but is important to heterogeneous scheduling research in general.},

Yet, mathematical notations remain mostly unutilized by today's systems. In this paper, we present the first in-depth study on the distributions of mathematical notation in two large scientific corpora: the open access arXiv (2.5B mathematical objects) and the mathematical reviewing service for pure and applied mathematics zbMATH (61M mathematical objects). Our study lays a foundation for future research projects on mathematical information retrieval for large scientific corpora. Further, we demonstrate the relevance of our results to a variety of use-cases. For example, to assist semantic extraction systems, to improve scientific search engines, and to facilitate specialized math recommendation systems. The contributions of our presented research are as follows: (1) we present the first distributional analysis of mathematical formulae on arXiv and zbMATH; (2) we retrieve relevant mathematical objects for given textual search queries (e.g., linking with `Jacobi polynomial'); (3) we extend zbMATH's search engine by providing relevant mathematical formulae; and (4) we exemplify the applicability of the results by presenting auto-completion for math inputs as the first contribution to math recommendation systems.

  abstract = {Word embedding, which represents individual words with semantically fixed-length vectors, has made it possible to successfully apply deep learning to natural language processing tasks such as semantic role-modeling, question answering, and machine translation. As math text consists of natural text, as well as math expressions that similarly exhibit linear correlation and contextual characteristics, word embedding techniques can also be applied to math documents. However, while mathematics is a precise and accurate science, it is usually expressed through imprecise and less accurate descriptions, contributing to the relative dearth of machine learning applications for information retrieval in this domain. Generally, mathematical documents communicate their knowledge with an ambiguous, context-dependent, and non-formal language. Given recent advances in word embedding, it is worthwhile to explore their use and effectiveness in math information retrieval tasks, such as math language processing and semantic knowledge extraction. In this paper, we explore math embedding by testing it on several different scenarios, namely, (1) math-term similarity, (2) analogy, (3) numerical concept-modeling based on the centroid of the keywords that characterize a concept, (4) math search using query expansions, and (5) semantic extraction, i.e., extracting descriptive phrases for math expressions. Due to the lack of benchmarks, our investigations were performed using the arXiv collection of STEM documents and carefully selected illustrations on the Digital Library of Mathematical Functions (DLMF: NIST digital library of mathematical functions. Release 1.0.20 of 2018-09-1, 2018). Our results show that math embedding holds much promise for similarity, analogy, and search tasks. However, we also observed the need for more robust math embedding approaches. Moreover, we explore and discuss fundamental issues that we believe thwart the progress in mathematical information retrieval in the direction of machine learning.},

To improve the memory efficiency in index, an encoding technique is introduced which encode CMML mathematical expressions in Braille Unicode characters. In order to improve ranking of retrieved documents, a weighting function is introduced which assign a weight to each indexing term. The weighting score of each term contributes in ranking function that improves the rank of a document which contains query terms. The proposed technique is evaluated on NTCIR-12 Wikipedia and Arxiv corpora. Performance is also measured using NTCIR-MathIR evaluation criteria. The precision for Wikipedia-formula-queries is achieved 47\% and for Arxiv is achieved 44\% at top 5 documents.},

One deals with the information processing distance between the user's intentions and the facilities provided by the machine. Reduction of this distance makes the interface feel direct by reducing the effort required of the user to accomplish goals. The second phenomenon concerns the relation between the input and output vocabularies of the interface language. In particular, direct manipulation requires that the system provide representations of objects that behave as if they are the objects themselves. This provides the feeling of directness of manipulation.},

Moreover, repositories and websites, including ArXiv and Wikipedia, and growing numbers of digital libraries use these structural formats to present mathematical formulae. This presents an important new and challenging area of research, namely Mathematical Information Retrieval (MIR). In this paper, we propose WikiMirs, a tool to facilitate mathematical formula retrieval in Wikipedia. WikiMirs is aimed at searching for similar mathematical formulae based upon both textual and spatial similarities, using a new indexing and matching model developed for layout structures. A hierarchical generalization technique is proposed to generate sub-trees from presentation trees of mathematical formulae, and similarity is calculated based upon matching at different levels of these trees. Experimental results show that WikiMirs can efficiently support sub-structure matching and similarity matching of mathematical formulae.

  abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve best-known accuracies in many machine learning tasks involved in image, voice, and natural language processing and are being used in an ever-increasing range of applications. However, their algorithmic benefits are accompanied by extremely high computation and storage costs, sparking intense efforts in optimizing the design of computing platforms for DNNs. Today, graphics processing units (GPUs) and specialized digital CMOS accelerators represent the state-of-the-art in DNN hardware, with near-term efforts focusing on approximate computing through reduced precision. However, the ever-increasing complexities of DNNs and the data they process have fueled an active interest in alternative hardware fabrics that can deliver the next leap in efficiency. Resistive crossbars designed using emerging nonvolatile memory technologies have emerged as a promising candidate building block for future DNN hardware fabrics since they can natively execute massively parallel vector-matrix multiplications (the dominant compute kernel in DNNs) in the analog domain within the memory arrays. Leveraging in-memory computing and dense storage, resistive-crossbar-based systems cater to both the high computation and storage demands of complex DNNs and promise energy efficiency beyond current DNN accelerators by mitigating data transfer and memory bottlenecks. However, several design challenges need to be addressed to enable their adoption. For example, the overheads of peripheral circuits (analog-to-digital converters and digital-to-analog converters) and other components (scratchpad memories and on-chip interconnect) may significantly diminish the efficiency benefits at the system level. Additionally, the analog crossbar computations are intrinsically subject to noise due to a range of device- and circuit-level nonidealities, potentially leading to lower accuracy at the application level. In this article, we highlight the prospects for designing hardware accelerators for neural networks using resistive crossbars. We also underscore the key open challenges and some possible approaches to address them.},

  abstract = {Resistive crossbars designed with non-volatile memory devices have emerged as promising building blocks for Deep Neural Network (DNN) hardware, due to their ability to compactly and efficiently realize vector-matrix multiplication (VMM), the dominant computational kernel in DNNs. However, a key challenge with resistive crossbars is that they suffer from a range of device and circuit level non-idealities such as interconnect parasitics, peripheral circuits, sneak paths, and process variations. These non-idealities can lead to errors in VMMs, eventually degrading the DNN's accuracy. It is therefore critical to study the impact of crossbar non-idealities on the accuracy of large-scale DNNs. However, this is challenging because existing device and circuit models are too slow to use in application-level evaluations. We present RxNN, a fast and accurate simulation framework to evaluate large-scale DNNs on resistive crossbar systems. RxNN splits and maps the computations involved in each DNN layer into crossbar operations, and evaluates them using a Fast Crossbar Model (FCM) that accurately captures the errors arising due to crossbar non-idealities while being four-to-five orders of magnitude faster than circuit simulation. FCM models a crossbar-based VMM operation using three stages - non-linear models for the input and output peripheral circuits (DACs and ADCs), and an equivalent non-ideal conductance matrix for the core crossbar array. We implement RxNN by extending the Caffe machine learning framework and use it to evaluate a suite of six large-scale DNNs developed for the ImageNet Challenge. Our experiments reveal that resistive crossbar non-idealities can lead to significant accuracy degradations (9.6\%-32\%) for these large-scale DNNs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first quantitative evaluation of the accuracy of large-scale DNNs on resistive crossbar based hardware.},

The structure consists of an inert electrode and one oxidized electrode of copper (Cu) or silver (Ag). The switching mechanism is the formation/dissolution of a metallic filament in the switching materials under external bias. However, the growth dynamics of the metallic filament in different switching materials are still debated. All CBRAM devices are switching under an operation current of 0.1~{$\mu$}A to 1~mA, and an operation voltage of {$\pm$}2~V is also needed. The device can reach a low current of 5 pA; however, current compliance-dependent reliability is a challenging issue. Although a chalcogenide-based material has opportunity to have better endurance as compared to an oxide-based material, data retention and integration with the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process are also issues. Devices with bilayer switching materials show better resistive switching characteristics as compared to those with a single switching layer, especially a program/erase endurance of {$>$}105~cycles with a high speed of few nanoseconds. Multi-level cell operation is possible, but the stability of the high resistance state is also an important reliability concern. These devices show a good data retention of {$>$}105~s at {$>$}85\textdegree C. However, more study is needed to achieve a 10-year guarantee of data retention for non-volatile memory application. The crossbar memory is benefited for high density with low power operation. Some CBRAM devices as a chip have been reported for proto-typical production. This review shows that operation current should be optimized for few microamperes with a maintaining speed of few nanoseconds, which will have challenges and also opportunities for three-dimensional (3D) architecture.},

We evaluate the IPU's compute power over matrix multiplication, convolution, and AI/ML primitives. We discuss actual performance in comparison with its theoretical limits. Our findings reveal how the IPU's architectural design affects its performance. Moreover, they offer simple mental models to predict an application's performance on the IPU, on the basis of the computation and communication steps it involves.

  abstract = {The rapid growth of research publications has placed great demands on digital libraries (DL) for advanced information management technologies. To cater to these demands, techniques relying on knowledge-graph structures are being advocated. In such graph-based pipelines, inferring semantic relations between related scientific concepts is a crucial step. Recently, BERT-based pre-trained models have been popularly explored for automatic relation classification. Despite significant progress, most of them were evaluated in different scenarios, which limits their comparability. Furthermore, existing methods are primarily evaluated on clean texts, which ignores the digitization context of early scholarly publications in terms of machine scanning and optical character recognition (OCR). In such cases, the texts may contain OCR noise, in turn creating uncertainty about existing classifiers' performances. To address these limitations, we started by creating OCR-noisy texts based on three clean corpora. Given these parallel corpora, we conducted a thorough empirical evaluation of eight Bert-based classification models by focusing on three factors: (1) Bert variants; (2) classification strategies; and, (3) OCR noise impacts. Experiments on clean data show that the domain-specific pre-trained Bert is the best variant to identify scientific relations. The strategy of predicting a single relation each time outperforms the one simultaneously identifying multiple relations in general. The optimal classifier's performance can decline by around 10\% to 20\% in F-score on the noisy corpora. Insights discussed in this study can help DL stakeholders select techniques for building optimal knowledge-graph-based systems.},

However, Bayesian inference is a computing-intensive task whose efficiency is physically limited by the bottlenecks of conventional computing platforms. In this work, a spintronics based stochastic computing approach is proposed for efficient Bayesian inference. The inherent stochastic switching behaviors of spintronic devices are exploited to build stochastic bitstream generator (SBG) for stochastic computing with hybrid CMOS/MTJ circuits design. Aiming to improve the inference efficiency, an SBG sharing strategy is leveraged to reduce the required SBG array scale by integrating a switch network between SBG array and stochastic computing logic. A device-to-architecture level framework is proposed to evaluate the performance of spintronics based Bayesian inference system (SPINBIS). Experimental results on data fusion applications have shown that SPINBIS could improve the energy efficiency about 12X than MTJ-based approach with 45\% design area overhead and about 26X than FPGA-based approach.},

As distinct from text retrieval, however, mathematical symbols in isolation do not contain much semantic information, and the structure of an expression must be considered as well. Unfortunately, considering the structure to calculate the relevance scores of documents results in ranking algorithms that are computationally more expensive than the typical ranking algorithms employed for text documents. As a result, current math retrieval systems either limit themselves to exact matches, or they ignore the structure completely; they sacrifice either recall or precision for efficiency. We propose instead an efficient end-to-end math retrieval system based on a structural similarity ranking algorithm. We describe novel optimizations techniques to reduce the index size and the query processing time, and we experimentally validate our system in terms of correctness and efficiency. Thus, with the proposed optimizations, mathematical contents can be fully exploited to rank documents in response to mathematical queries.},

  abstract = {Symbolic regression, the task of predicting the mathematical expression of a function from the observation of its values, is a difficult task which usually involves a two-step procedure: predicting the "skeleton" of the expression up to the choice of numerical constants, then fitting the constants by optimizing a non-convex loss function. The dominant approach is genetic programming, which evolves candidates by iterating this subroutine a large number of times. Neural networks have recently been tasked to predict the correct skeleton in a single try, but remain much less powerful. In this paper, we challenge this two-step procedure, and task a Transformer to directly predict the full mathematical expression, constants included. One can subsequently refine the predicted constants by feeding them to the non-convex optimizer as an informed initialization. We present ablations to show that this end-to-end approach yields better results, sometimes even without the refinement step. We evaluate our model on problems from the SRBench benchmark and show that our model approaches the performance of state-of-the-art genetic programming with several orders of magnitude faster inference.},

  abstract = {The goal of this paper is to investigate the short time-scale, thermally-induced probability of magnetization reversal for an biaxial nanomagnet that is characterized with a biaxial magnetic anisotropy. For the first time, we clearly show that for a given energy barrier of the nanomagnet, the magnetization reversal probability of an biaxial nanomagnet exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on its saturation magnetization. Specifically, there are two reasons for this non-monotonic behavior in rectangular thin-film nanomagnets that have a large perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. First, a large perpendicular anisotropy lowers the precessional period of the magnetization making it more likely to precess across the  {$\mathsl{x}$}{\^ }~ =0  plane if the magnetization energy exceeds the energy barrier. Second, the thermal-field torque at a particular energy increases as the magnitude of the perpendicular anisotropy increases during the magnetization precession. This non-monotonic behavior is most noticeable when analyzing the magnetization reversals on time-scales up to several tens of ns. In light of the several proposals of spintronic devices that require data retention on time-scales up to 10's of ns, understanding the probability of magnetization reversal on the short time-scales is important. As such, the results presented in this paper will be helpful in quantifying the reliability and noise sensitivity of spintronic devices in which thermal noise is inevitably present.},

The optimal parameter set for the chaotic systems has been chosen by carrying out numerical simulations of the system and adopting the scale index parameter to determine the degree of non-periodicity of the obtained bit streams. The proposed TRBG system has been then modeled and co-simulated on the Xilinx System Generator (XSG) platform and implemented on the Xilinx Kintex-7 KC705 FPGA Evaluation Board, obtaining experimental results in agreement with the expectations. Finally, the system has been validated with statistical analysis by using the NIST 800.22 statistical test suite.},

In these analog neural networks, the weights to be adjusted are implemented by the conductances of programmable resistive devices such as memristors [Chua, 1971], and the nonlinear transfer functions (or `activation functions') are implemented by nonlinear components such as diodes. We show mathematically that a class of analog neural networks (called nonlinear resistive networks) are energy-based models: they possess an energy function as a consequence of Kirchhoff's laws governing electrical circuits. This property enables us to train them using the Equilibrium Propagation framework [Scellier and Bengio, 2017]. Our update rule for each conductance, which is local and relies solely on the voltage drop across the corresponding resistor, is shown to compute the gradient of the loss function. Our numerical simulations, which use the SPICE-based Spectre simulation framework to simulate the dynamics of electrical circuits, demonstrate training on the MNIST classification task, performing comparably or better than equivalent-size software-based neural networks. Our work can guide the development of a new generation of ultra-fast, compact and low-power neural networks supporting on-chip learning.},

In current study, Seq2Seq models have been used for eBay product description summarization. We propose a novel Document-Context based Seq2Seq models using RNNs for abstractive and extractive summarizations. Intuitively, this is similar to humans reading the title, abstract or any other contextual information before reading the document. This gives humans a high-level idea of what the document is about. We use this idea and propose that Seq2Seq models should be started with contextual information at the first time-step of the input to obtain better summaries. In this manner, the output summaries are more document centric, than being generic, overcoming one of the major hurdles of using generative models. We generate document-context from user-behavior and seller provided information. We train and evaluate our models on human-extracted-golden-summaries. The document-contextual Seq2Seq models outperform standard Seq2Seq models. Moreover, generating human extracted summaries is prohibitively expensive to scale, we therefore propose a semi-supervised technique for extracting approximate summaries and using it for training Seq2Seq models at scale. Semi-supervised models are evaluated against human extracted summaries and are found to be of similar efficacy. We provide side by side comparison for abstractive and extractive summarizers (contextual and non-contextual) on same evaluation dataset. Overall, we provide methodologies to use and evaluate the proposed techniques for large document summarization. Furthermore, we found these techniques to be highly effective, which is not the case with existing techniques.},

After training our model, we extract and evaluate our vectors with linear models on 8 tasks: semantic relatedness, paraphrase detection, image-sentence ranking, question-type classification and 4 benchmark sentiment and subjectivity datasets.

  abstract = {This paper describes the participation of our MCAT search system in the NTCIR-11 Math-2 Task. The purpose of this task is to search mathematical expressions using hybrid queries containing both formulae and keywords. We introduce an encoding technique to capture the structure and content of the mathematical expressions. Each expression is accompanied by two types of automatically extracted textual information, namely words in context window and descriptions. In addition, we examine the improvement in ranking obtained by utilizing dependency graph of mathematical expressions and post-retrieval reranking method. The results show that the use of description and dependency graph together delivers better ranking performances than the use of context window. Furthermore, using both the description and context window together delivers even better results. The evaluation results also indicate that our reranking method is effective for improving the ranking performances.},

We introduce three granularity levels of textual information, new approach for generating dependency graph of math expressions, score normalization, cold-start weights, and unification. We find that these modules, except the cold-start weights, have a very good impact on the search performance of our system. The use of dependency graph significantly improves precision of our system, i.e., up to 24.52\% and 104.20\% relative improvements in the Main and Simto subtasks of the arXiv task, respectively. In addition, the implementation of unification delivers up to 2.90\% and 57.14\% precision improvements in the Main and Simto subtasks, respectively. Overall, our best submission achieves P@5 of 0.5448 in the Main subtask and 0.5500 in the Simto subtask. In the Wikipedia task, our system also performs well at the MathWikiFormula subtask. At the MathWiki subtask, however, due to a problem with handling queries formed as questions that contain many stop words, our system finishes second.},

In this paper, we study the problem of automatically grading the kinds of open response mathematical questions that figure prominently in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses. Our data-driven framework for mathematical language processing (MLP) leverages solution data from a large number of learners to evaluate the correctness of their solutions, assign partial-credit scores, and provide feedback to each learner on the likely locations of any errors. MLP takes inspiration from the success of natural language processing for text data and comprises three main steps. First, we convert each solution to an open response mathematical question into a series of numerical features. Second, we cluster the features from several solutions to uncover the structures of correct, partially correct, and incorrect solutions. We develop two different clustering approaches, one that leverages generic clustering algorithms and one based on Bayesian nonparametrics. Third, we automatically grade the remaining (potentially large number of) solutions based on their assigned cluster and one instructor-provided grade per cluster. As a bonus, we can track the cluster assignment of each step of a multistep solution and determine when it departs from a cluster of correct solutions, which enables us to indicate the likely locations of errors to learners. We test and validate MLP on real-world MOOC data to demonstrate how it can substantially reduce the human effort required in large-scale educational platforms.},

The interfaces between analog and digital units, especially AD/DAs, take up most of the area and power consumption of RCS and are always the bottleneck of mixed-signal computing systems. In this work, we propose a novel architecture, MEI, to minimize the overhead of AD/DA by MErging the Interface into the RRAM crossbar. An optional ensemble method, the Serial Array Adaptive Boosting (SAAB), is also introduced to take advantage of the area and power saved by MEI and boost the accuracy and robustness of RCS. On top of these two methods, a design space exploration is proposed to achieve trade-offs among accuracy, area, and power consumption. Experimental results on 6 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that, compared with the traditional architecture with AD/DAs, MEI is able to save 54.63\%\textasciitilde 86.14\% area and reduce 61.82\%\textasciitilde 86.80\% power consumption under quality guarantees; and SAAB can further improve the accuracy by 5.76\% on average and ensure the system performance under noisy conditions.},

  abstract = {With the rise of portable wearable devices, it is easier for users to save their lifelog data. As lifelog is usually disorganized with multi-modal information (even noisy sometimes), an interactive search engine is crucial for users to review and explore their lifelog. Unlike traditional search engines, lifelog search includes multi-modality information of images, text and other data from sensors, which brings challenges to data arrangement and search. Accordingly, users' information need is also multi-level. Hence, a single interaction mechanism may not be able to satisfy users' requirements. As the data set is highly personalized, interaction and feedback from users should also be considered in the search engine. Therefore, in this paper we present an interactive multi-modality lifelog search engine to help users manage and find lifelog data. To this end, lifelog data is clustered and processed in multi-level processing. Then, we build an interactive search engine, includingtext as query, image as query, andtimeline view modules. Besides, the system is able to adopt user feedback mechanisms in multi-round queries. Our system shows promising experimental results on LSC'20 dataset and development topics. The text-based search module gives correct results on more than 60\% of the development topics at LSC'20.},

This paper proposes an innovative mathematics retrieval system along with the novel algorithms, which enables efficient formula index and retrieval from both webpages and PDF documents. Unlike prior studies, which require users to manually input formula markup language as query, the new system enables users to ``copy'' formula queries directly from PDF documents. Furthermore, by using a novel indexing and matching model, the system is aimed at searching for similar mathematical formulae based on both textual and spatial similarities. A hierarchical generalization technique is proposed to generate sub-trees from the semi-operator tree of formulae and support substructure match and fuzzy match. Experiments based on massive Wikipedia and CiteSeer repositories show that the new system along with novel algorithms, comparing with two representative mathematics retrieval systems, provides more efficient mathematical formula index and retrieval, while simplifying user query input for PDF documents.},

  abstract = {In this paper, three image features are proposed for image retrieval. In addition, a feature selection technique is also brought forward to select optimal features to not only maximize the detection rate but also simplify the computation of image retrieval. The first and second image features are based on color and texture features, respectively called color co-occurrence matrix (CCM) and difference between pixels of scan pattern (DBPSP) in this paper. The third image feature is based on color distribution, called color histogram for K-mean (CHKM). CCM is the conventional pattern co-occurrence matrix that calculates the probability of the occurrence of same pixel color between each pixel and its adjacent ones in each image, and this probability is considered as the attribute of the image. According to the sequence of motifs of scan patterns, DBPSP calculates the difference between pixels and converts it into the probability of occurrence on the entire image. Each pixel color in an image is then replaced by one color in the common color palette that is most similar to color so as to classify all pixels in image into k-cluster, called the CHKM feature. Difference in image properties and contents indicates that different features are contained. Some images have stronger color and texture features, while others are more sensitive to color and spatial features. Thus, this study integrates CCM, DBPSP, and CHKM to facilitate image retrieval. To enhance image detection rate and simplify computation of image retrieval, sequential forward selection is adopted for feature selection. Besides, based on the image retrieval system (CTCHIRS), a series of analyses and comparisons are performed in our experiment. Three image databases with different properties are used to carry out feature selection. Optimal features are selected from original features to enhance the detection rate.},

Matrices with ellipses can be recognized and instantiated with non-ellipsis elements. Both well- and non-well-formed matrices can also be recognized. Matrix elements can be any general mathematical expressions including imbedded matrices. Our recognizer also addresses the poor column alignment problem of handwritten matrices, and allows for slight horizontal overlaps between elements in neighboring columns and different rows.},

The memristor-based neural network further demonstrates a power efficient hardware realization of ANN. Training phase is the critical operation of memristor-based neural network. However, the traditional training method for memristor-based neural network is time consuming and energy inefficient. Users have to first work out the parameters of memristors through digital computing systems and then tune the memristor to the corresponding state. In this work, we introduce a mixed-signal training acceleration framework, which realizes the self-training of memristor-based neural network. We first modify the original stochastic gradient descent algorithm by approximating calculations and designing an alternative computing method. We then propose a mixed-signal acceleration architecture for the modified training algorithm by equipping the original memristor-based neural network architecture with the copy crossbar technique, weight update units, sign calculation units and other assistant units. The experiment on the MNIST database demonstrates that the proposed mixed-signal acceleration is 3 orders of magnitude faster and 4 orders of magnitude more energy efficient than the CPU implementation counterpart at the cost of a slight decrease of the recognition accuracy ({$<$}; 5\%).},

Our empirical evaluation with state-of-the-art neural coreference resolution and textbook RNN-based language models trained on benchmark data sets finds significant gender bias in how models view occupations. We then mitigate bias with counterfactual data augmentation (CDA): a generic methodology for corpus augmentation via causal interventions that breaks associations between gendered and gender-neutral words. We empirically show that CDA effectively decreases gender bias while preserving accuracy. We also explore the space of mitigation strategies with CDA, a prior approach to word embedding debiasing (WED), and their compositions. We show that CDA outperforms WED, drastically so when word embeddings are trained. For pre-trained embeddings, the two methods can be effectively composed. We also find that as training proceeds on the original data set with gradient descent the gender bias grows as the loss reduces, indicating that the optimization encourages bias; CDA mitigates this behavior.},

This correspondence is used to label sentences with performance that approaches a fully supervised baseline. For multi-aspect rating prediction, we find that overall ratings can be used in conjunction with our sentence labelings to achieve reasonable performance compared to a fully supervised baseline. When gold-standard aspect-ratings are available, we find that topic model based features can be used to improve unsophisticated supervised baseline performance, in agreement with previous multi-aspect rating prediction work.

The flow now models energy consumption, an increasingly important concern. The speed and quality of the packing algorithms have been significantly improved. VTR can now generate a netlist of the final post-routed circuit which enables detailed simulation of a design for a variety of purposes.

  abstract = {Automated reasoning technology provides means for inference in a formal context via a multitude of disparate reasoning techniques. Combining different techniques not only increases the effectiveness of single systems but also provides a more powerful approach to solving hard problems. Consequently combined reasoning systems have been successfully employed to solve non-trivial mathematical problems in combinatorially rich domains that are intractable by traditional mathematical means.  Nevertheless, the lack of domain specific knowledge often limits the effectiveness of these systems.  In this thesis we investigate how the combination of diverse reasoning techniques can be employed to pre-compute additional knowledge to enable mathematical discovery in finite and potentially infinite domains that is otherwise not feasible. In particular, we demonstrate how we can exploit bespoke symbolic computations and automated theorem proving to automatically compute and evolve the structural knowledge of small size finite structures in the algebraic theory of quasigroups. This allows us to increase the solvability horizon of model generation systems to find solution models for large size finite algebraic structures previously unattainable. We also present an approach to exploring infinite models using a mixture of automated tools and user interaction to iteratively inspect the structure of solutions and refine search. A practical implementation combines a specialist term rewriting system with bespoke graph algorithms and visualization tools and has been applied to solve the generalized version of Kuratowski's classical closure-complement problem from point-set topology that had remained open for several years.},

ScanSSD detects characters in formulas with high accuracy, obtaining a 0.926 f-score, and detects formulas with high recall overall. Detection errors are largely minor, such as splitting formulas at large whitespace gaps (e.g., for variable constraints) and merging formulas on adjacent textlines.

To begin to gain some insight into that question, this paper examines the nature of queries for mathematical concepts that were created by users of a search engine. A total of 392,586 queries that contained at least one distinctive mathematical term (e.g., "Taylor Series") were identified in a two-year query log from the Parsijoo search engine; these queries were each issued in one of 69,014 search sessions. Descriptive and comparative analysis indicates that math search sessions are typically longer and less successful than general search sessions. Queries for mathematical concepts exhibit greater diversity than do queries in general - essentially the query distribution is nearly all "tail." The use of well-formed questions as queries (e.g., "How can I prove that ...") is also surprisingly common, as is the creation of queries by copying text from a document. Among the implications of this study for the design of search engines with specialized functions for handling mathematical notation are that robust support for query refinement and reformulation could prove beneficial.},

We expect this to be a challenging task, as both math and text may be needed to find relevant answer posts. While several models have been proposed for text question answering, math question answering is in an earlier stage of development. To advance math-aware search and mathematical question answering systems, we will create a standard test collection for researchers to use for benchmarking. ARQMath will also include a formula retrieval sub-task: individual formulas from question posts are used to locate formulas in earlier answer posts, with relevance determined by narrative fields created based on the original question. We will use these narrative fields to explore diverse information needs for formula search (e.g., alternative notation, applications in specific fields or definition).},

While there have been many attempts at embedding words and graphs, formula embedding is in its early stages. We introduce a new formula embedding model that we use with two hierarchical representations, (1) Symbol Layout Trees (SLTs) for appearance, and (2) Operator Trees (OPTs) for mathematical content. Following the approach of graph embeddings such as DeepWalk, we generate tuples representing paths between pairs of symbols depth-first, embed tuples using the fastText n-gram embedding model, and then represent an SLT or OPT by its average tuple embedding vector. We then combine SLT and OPT embeddings, leading to state-of-the-art results for the NTCIR-12 formula retrieval task. Our fine-grained holistic vector representations allow us to retrieve many more partially similar formulas than methods using structural matching in trees. Combining our embedding model with structural matching in the Approach0 formula search engine produces state-of-the-art results for both fully and partially relevant results on the NTCIR-12 benchmark. Source code for our system is publicly available.},

The NVIDIA Tesla V100 accelerator, featuring the Volta microarchitecture, provides 640 Tensor Cores with a theoretical peak performance of 125 Tflops/s in mixed precision. In this paper, we investigate current approaches to program NVIDIA Tensor Cores, their performances and the precision loss due to computation in mixed precision. Currently, NVIDIA provides three different ways of programming matrix-multiply-and-accumulate on Tensor Cores: the CUDA Warp Matrix Multiply Accumulate (WMMA) API, CUTLASS, a templated library based on WMMA, and cuBLAS GEMM. After experimenting with different approaches, we found that NVIDIA Tensor Cores can deliver up to 83 Tflops/s in mixed precision on a Tesla V100 GPU, seven and three times the performance in single and half precision respectively. A WMMA implementation of batched GEMM reaches a performance of 4 Tflops/s. While precision loss due to matrix multiplication with half precision input might be critical in many HPC applications, it can be considerably reduced at the cost of increased computation. Our results indicate that HPC applications using matrix multiplications can strongly benefit from using of NVIDIA Tensor Cores.},

Recent claims of well-performing MOSFETs with gate lengths below 4 nm apparently defy the fundamental limit of source-to-drain direct tunneling (SDDT). Here, we investigate that limit by simulating gate-all-around Si nanowire FETs with gate lengths between 8 and 3 nm using the state-of-the-art atomistic quantum transport modeling. We find that at 3-nm gate length, the current is dominated by SDDT, resulting in large source-drain leakage and poor switching performance even if the gate modulates the potential barrier between the source and drain sufficiently well. However, at 6-nm gate-length SDDT barely starts to degrade the subthreshold characteristics at large drain bias, and the ballistic ON-/OFF-current ratio is 106 with a subthreshold swing of 70 mV/decade, on par with contemporary Si technology. This means that in the best case, the technology roadmap could potentially be extended for several generations beyond the currently projected nodes. In addition, the results substantiate that the experimental devices with the claimed gate lengths below 6 nm in fact operate with a longer effective gate lengths.},

Naturally, mathematicians are more likely to resist using a computer as a tool in their work if the tedious task of learning a new language for mathematics is part of the bargain. Furthermore, until a new language is thoroughly learned, difficulty in communication will make it less likely that their new experience will be a successful one. Beyond that, if a new computer language does not provide the same visual clues as standard mathematical notation, it may never adequately serve the mathematician. It therefore seems fair to assume that the computer input/output of mathematical expressions in a form resembling standard notation is an important goal. This form of expression is considerably more complex and expensive to handle than those used in, for example, the programming language FORTRAN. But the alternative (e.g., correctly manipulating a one page FORTRAN expression) is often quite painful.},

The best performing approach identifies all but two of our real-world test cases at the top rank and achieves a mean reciprocal rank of 0.86. The results show that mathematical expressions are promising text-independent features to identify academic plagiarism in large collections.

Especially for the metal-oxide resistive random access memory (RRAM), its crossbar structure and multi-bit characteristic can perform the matrix-vector product in high precision, which is the most common operation of NN. However, there exist two challenges on realizing the training of NN. Firstly, the current architecture can only support the inference phase of training and cannot perform the backpropagation (BP), the weights update of NN. Secondly, the training of NN requires enormous iterations and constantly updates the weights to reach the convergence, which leads to large energy consumption because of lots of write and read operations. In this work, we propose a novel architecture, TIME, and peripheral circuit designs to enable the training of NN in RRAM. TIME supports the BP and the weights update while maximizing the reuse of peripheral circuits for the inference operation on RRAM. Meanwhile, a variability-free tuning scheme and gradually-write circuits are designed to reduce the cost of tuning RRAM. We explore the performance of both SL (supervised learning) and DRL (deep reinforcement learning) in TIME, and a specific mapping method of DRL is also introduced to further improve the energy efficiency. Experimental results show that, in SL, TIME can achieve 5.3\texttimes{} higher energy efficiency on average compared with the most powerful application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) in the literature. In DRL, TIME can perform averagely 126\texttimes{} higher than GPU in energy efficiency. If the cost of tuning RRAM can be further reduced, TIME have the potential of boosting the energy efficiency by 2 orders of magnitude compared with ASIC.},

The bento systems partition search results into separate zoned screen displays grouped by content format type and/or local service results. Recent studies on Web-scale discovery systems have identified a number of user access issues centering on problems with blended result displays, problematical relevancy rankings of search results, full-text search problems, and the inability of WSDS to adequately provide access to local library services and resources. The concept of ``full library discovery,'' a phrase first coined by Lorcan Dempsey, has been introduced to refer to discovery approaches that move beyond the retrieval of collection materials to also include local information services and local content and links. The bento-based systems are an attempt to address the identified problems with WSDS and also provide discovery services that address user needs, in particular known item search and streamlined full-text access. This presentation will provide an analysis of the 38 libraries presently employing the bento approach and will look at identified user needs and search behaviors, as revealed in detailed search and clickthrough transaction log analyses. There is a clear need for an evidence-based analysis of user search behaviors in retrieval environments characterized by access to distributed information resources.},

Resistive random access memory (ReRAM) is a promising technology for efficiently architecting PIM- and NN-based accelerators due to its capabilities to work as both: High-density/low-energy storage and in-memory computation/search engine. In this paper, we present a survey of techniques for designing ReRAM-based PIM and NN architectures. By classifying the techniques based on key parameters, we underscore their similarities and differences. This paper will be valuable for computer architects, chip designers and researchers in the area of machine learning.},

  abstract = {In recent years, variants of a neural network architecture for statistical language modeling have been proposed and successfully applied, e.g. in the language modeling component of speech recognizers. The main advantage of these architectures is that they learn an embedding for words (or other symbols) in a continuous space that helps to smooth the language model and provide good generalization even when the number of training examples is insufficient. However, these models are extremely slow in comparison to the more commonly used n-gram models, both for training and recognition. As an alternative to an importance sampling method proposed to speed-up training, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the conditional probabilities that yields a speed-up of about 200 both during training and recognition. The hierarchical decomposition is a binary hierarchical clustering constrained by the prior knowledge extracted from the WordNet semantic hierarchy.},

Regardless of the importance of mathematical formula search, conventional keyword-based retrieval methods are not sufficient for searching mathematical formulae, which are structured as trees. The increasing number as well as the structural complexity of mathematical formulae in scientific articles lead to the necessity for large-scale structureaware formula search techniques. In this paper, we formulate three types of measures that represent distinctive features of semantic similarity of math formulae, and develop efficient hash-based algorithms for the approximate calculation. Our experiments using NTCIR-11 Math-2 Task dataset, a large-scale test collection for math information retrieval with about 60million formulae, show that the proposed method improves the search precision while also keeps the scalability and runtime efficiency high.},

Yet the nature of the STEM contrast in which the structure is projected along the given direction precludes separation of possible structural models. Here, we utilize deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) trained on simulated 4D STEM datasets to predict structural descriptors of interfaces. We focus on the widely studied interface between LaAlO3 and SrTiO3, using dynamical diffraction theory and leveraging high performance computing to simulate thousands of possible 4D STEM datasets to train the DCNN to learn properties of the underlying structures on which the simulations are based. We test the DCNN on simulated data and show that it is possible (with {$>$}95\% accuracy) to identify a physically rough from a chemically diffuse interface and create a DCNN regression model to predict step positions. We quantify the applicability of the model to different thicknesses and the transferability of the approach. The method shown here is general and can be applied for any inverse imaging problem where forward models are present.},

In this paper, we compare two approaches to discover identifier-definition tuples. At first we use a simple pattern matching approach. Second, we present the MLP approach that uses part-of-speech tag based distances as well as sentence positions to calculate identifier-definition probabilities. The evaluation of our prototypical system, applied on the Wikipedia text corpus, shows that our approach augments the user experience substantially. While hovering the identifiers in the formula, tool-tips with the most probable definitions occur. Tests with random samples show that the displayed definitions provide a good match with the actual meaning of the identifiers.},

  abstract = {This paper develops a model that addresses sentence embedding, a hot topic in current natural language processing research, using recurrent neural networks with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. Due to its ability to capture long term memory, the LSTM-RNN accumulates increasingly richer information as it goes through the sentence, and when it reaches the last word, the hidden layer of the network provides a semantic representation of the whole sentence. In this paper, the LSTM-RNN is trained in a weakly supervised manner on user click-through data logged by a commercial web search engine. Visualization and analysis are performed to understand how the embedding process works. The model is found to automatically attenuate the unimportant words and detects the salient keywords in the sentence. Furthermore, these detected keywords are found to automatically activate different cells of the LSTM-RNN, where words belonging to a similar topic activate the same cell. As a semantic representation of the sentence, the embedding vector can be used in many different applications. These automatic keyword detection and topic allocation abilities enabled by the LSTM-RNN allow the network to perform document retrieval, a difficult language processing task, where the similarity between the query and documents can be measured by the distance between their corresponding sentence embedding vectors computed by the LSTM-RNN. On a web search task, the LSTM-RNN embedding is shown to significantly outperform several existing state of the art methods. We emphasize that the proposed model generates sentence embedding vectors that are specially useful for web document retrieval tasks. A comparison with a well known general sentence embedding method, the Paragraph Vector, is performed. The results show that the proposed method in this paper significantly outperforms it for web document retrieval task.},

As MEs are two-dimensional in nature, traditional text retrieval techniques used in natural language processing are not sufficient for their retrieval. In this paper, we have proposed a novel structure based approach to ME retrieval problem. In our approach, query given in \textbackslash LaTeX\textbackslash LaTeX\textbackslash mbox\{\textbackslash LaTeX\} format is preprocessed to eliminate extraneous keywords (like \textbackslash displaystyle, \textbackslash begin\{array\} etc.) while retaining the structure information like superscript and subscript relationships. MEs in the database are also preprocessed and stored in the same manner. We have created a database of 829 MEs in \textbackslash LaTeX\textbackslash LaTeX\textbackslash mbox\{\textbackslash LaTeX\} form, that covers various branches of mathematics like Algebra, Trigonometry, Calculus etc. Preprocessed query is matched against the database of preprocessed MEs using Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) algorithm. LCS algorithm is used as it preserves the order of keywords in the preprocessed MEs unlike bag of words approach in the traditional text retrieval techniques. We have incorporated structure information into LCS algorithm and proposed a measure based on the modified algorithm, for ranking MEs in the database. As proposed approach exploits structure information, it is closer to human intuition. Retrieval performance has been evaluated using standard precision measure.},

  abstract = {We consider the design of stochastic computing (SC) hardware based on spintronic devices. SC offers low-cost implementations of arithmetic operations and high degrees of error tolerance. When compared to charge-based devices, spin-based devices could be lower energy, nonvolatile, etc. However, spin-based devices can be fundamentally more error prone than charge-based devices. The marriage of SC architectures and spin-based devices has the potential to produce information processing systems that are robust, low energy, and nonvolatile. In this paper, we investigate SC hardware comprised of nanomagnetic logic (NML) devices. NML is a ``beyond-CMOS'' technology that uses bistable magnets to store, process, and move binary information. We introduce new NML circuit structures that exploit unique features of the technology to efficiently realize hardware components required for an SC system (e.g., random number generation). We also benchmark NML-based SC circuits against other implementations, and illustrate how features that are unique to NML (e.g., inherent pipelining) can lead to improved performance. Our results indicate NML SC implementations achieve smaller area footprints with reduced energy and delay when compared to CMOS equivalents.},

As an example of our approach, we have built several programmable analog circuits demonstrating memristor-based programming of threshold, gain and frequency.

The popular file distribution tool BitTorrent was explicitly designed to address this problem, using a tit-for-tat reciprocity strategy to provide positive incentives for nodes to contribute resources to the swarm. While BitTorrent has been extremely successful, we show that its incentive mechanism is not robust to strategic clients. Through performance modeling parameterized by real world traces, we demonstrate that all peers contribute resources that do not directly improve their performance. We use these results to drive the design and implementation of BitTyrant, a strategic BitTorrent client that provides a median 70\% performance gain for a 1 Mbit client on live Internet swarms. We further show that when applied universally, strategic clients can hurt average per-swarm performance compared to today's BitTorrent client implementations.},

The components in our model are no longer terms, but termsets. The novelty is that we compute term weights using a data mining technique called association rules, which is time efficient and yet yields nice improvements in retrieval effectiveness. The set-based model function for computing the similarity between a document and a query considers the termset frequency in the document and its scarcity in the document collection. Experimental results show that our model improves the average precision of the answer set for all three collections evaluated. For the TReC-3 collection, our set-based model led to a gain, relative to the standard vector space model, of 37\% in average precision curves and of 57\% in average precision for the top 10 documents. Like the vector space model, the set-based model has time complexity that is linear in the number of documents in the collection.},

It enables seamless integration of conversation history into a conversational question answering (ConvQA) model built on BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). We first explain our view that ConvQA is a simplified but concrete setting of conversational search, and then we provide a general framework to solve ConvQA. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under this framework. Finally, we analyze the impact of different numbers of history turns under different settings to provide new insights into conversation history modeling in ConvQA.},

In this paper we carry out a more comprehensive comparison of NN models including the recently proposed gated recurrent unit network, for two domain/intent classification tasks. Furthermore, whereas the previous work was confined to relatively small and controlled datasets, we now include experiments based on a large set obtained from the Cortana personal assistant application. We compare feedforward, recurrent, and gated \textemdash{} such as LSTM and GRU \textemdash{} networks against each other. On both the ATIS intent task and the much larger Cortana domain classification tasks, gated networks outperform recurrent models, which in turn outperform feedforward networks. Also, we compared standard word vector models against a representation which encodes words as sets of character n-grams to mitigate the out-of-vocabulary problem. We find that in nearly all cases, the standard word vectors outperform character-based word representations. Best results are obtained by linearly combining scores from NN models with log likelihood ratios obtained from N-gram language models.},

Since the speci cation from which we derive the conditional term rewriting system has some speci c Asf+Sdf features, the theory that supports this derivation is somewhat di erent from well-known term rewrite theories. To keep this supporting theory sound, not every Asf+Sdf feature is allowed. The property strongly normalizing is in general not decidable. We chose the method of recursive path orderings to be able to prove the property for a subset of the possible term rewriting systems. The future Asf+Sdf Meta-environment will be based on Asf+Sdf speci cations, so-called meta-level speci cations.

  abstract = {To facilitate the development of future FPGA architectures and CAD tools -- both embedded programmable fabrics and pure-play FPGAs -- there is a need for a large scale, publicly available software suite that can synthesize circuits into easily-described hypothetical FPGA architectures. These circuits should be captured at the HDL level, or higher, and pass through logical and physical synthesis. Such a tool must provide detailed modelling of area, performance and energy to enable architecture exploration. As software flows themselves evolve to permit design capture at ever higher levels of abstraction, this downstream full-implementation flow will always be required. This paper describes the current status and new release of an ongoing effort to create such a flow - the 'Verilog to Routing' (VTR) project, which is a broad collaboration of researchers. There are three core tools: ODIN II for Verilog Elaboration and front-end hard-block synthesis, ABC for logic synthesis, and VPR for physical synthesis and analysis. ODIN II now has a simulation capability to help verify that its output is correct, as well as specialized synthesis at the elaboration step for multipliers and memories. ABC is used to optimize the 'soft' logic of the FPGA. The VPR-based packing, placement and routing is now fully timing-driven (the previous release was not) and includes new capability to target complex logic blocks. In addition we have added a set of four large benchmark circuits to a suite of previously-released Verilog HDL circuits. Finally, we illustrate the use of the new flow by using it to help architect a floating-point unit in an FPGA, and contrast it with a prior, much longer effort that was required to do the same thing.},

However, existing learning techniques either are based on heuristics or fail to analyze the working conditions. Furthermore, there is almost no in depth study on how to effectively learn from the users when there are multiple visual features in the retrieval system. To address these limitations, in this paper we present a vigorous optimization formulation of the learning process and solve the problem in a principled way. By using Lagrange multipliers, we have derived explicit solutions, which are both optimal and fast to compute. Extensive comparisons against state-of-the-art techniques have been performed. Experiments were carried out on a large-size heterogeneous image collection consisting of 17,000 images. Retrieval performance was tested under a wide range of conditions. Various evaluation criteria, including precision-recall curve and rank measure, have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique.},

We use the length of the activity vector to represent the probability that the entity exists and its orientation to represent the instantiation parameters. Active capsules at one level make predictions, via transformation matrices, for the instantiation parameters of higher-level capsules. When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes active. We show that a discrimininatively trained, multi-layer capsule system achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and is considerably better than a convolutional net at recognizing highly overlapping digits. To achieve these results we use an iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism: A lower-level capsule prefers to send its output to higher level capsules whose activity vectors have a big scalar product with the prediction coming from the lower-level capsule.},

We propose an efficient Earley-based algorithm for incremental TSG parsing and report an F-score competitive with other incremental parsers. In addition to whole-sentence F-score, we also evaluate the partial trees that the parser constructs for sentence prefixes; partial trees play an important role in incremental interpretation, language modeling, and psycholinguistics. Unlike existing parsers, our incremental TSG parser can generate partial trees that include predictions about the upcoming words in a sentence. We show that it outperforms an n-gram model in predicting more than one upcoming word.},

We believe that the findings from the ARQMath evaluation will generate new insights into which index structures are most suitable to satisfy mathematical information needs. Search engines, recommender systems, plagiarism checking software, and many other added-value services acting on databases such as the arXiv and zbMATH need to combine natural and formula language. One initial approach to address this challenge is to enrich the mostly unstructured document data via Entity Linking. The ARQMath Task at CLEF 2020 aims to tackle the problem of linking newly posted questions from Math Stack Exchange (MSE) to existing ones that were already answered by the community. To deeply understand MSE information needs, answer-, and formula types, we performed manual runs for tasks 1 and 2. Furthermore, we explored several formula retrieval methods: For task 2, such as fuzzy string search, k-nearest neighbors, and our recently introduced approach to retrieve Mathematical Objects of Interest (MOI) with textual search queries. The task results show that neither our automated methods nor our manual runs archived good scores in the competition. However, the perceived quality of the hits returned by the MOI search particularly motivates us to conduct further research about MOI.},

Knowing the definitions of the identifiers in mathematical formulae is essential to understand the semantics of the formulae. Similar to the sense-making process of human readers, mathematical information retrieval systems can analyze the text that surrounds formulae to extract the definitions of identifiers occurring in the formulae. Several approaches for extracting the definitions of mathematical identifiers from documents have been proposed in recent years. So far, these approaches have been evaluated using different collections and gold standard datasets, which prevented comparative performance assessments. To facilitate future research on the task of identifier definition extraction, we make three contributions. First, we provide an automated evaluation framework, which uses the dataset and gold standard of the NTCIR-11 Math Retrieval Wikipedia task. Second, we compare existing identifier extraction approaches using the developed evaluation framework. Third, we present a new identifier extraction approach that uses machine learning to combine the well-performing features of previous approaches. The new approach increases the precision of extracting identifier definitions from 17.85\% to 48.60\%, and increases the recall from 22.58\% to 28.06\%.

For 26 of the 30 topics, the average relevance score of our manually retrieved results exceeded the average relevance score of other participants by more than one standard deviation. However, math search engines at large achieved better recall and retrieved highly relevant results that our `single-brain system' missed for 12 topics. By categorizing the topics of NTCIR-12 into six types of queries, we observe a particular strength of math search engines to answer queries of the types `definition lookup' and `application look-up'. However, we see the low precision of current math search engines as the main challenge that prevents their wide-spread adoption in STEM research. By combining our results with highly relevant results of all other participants, we compile a new gold standard dataset and a dataset of duplicate content items. We discuss how the two datasets can be used to improve the query formulation and content augmentation capabilities of match search engines in the future.},

  abstract = {Mathematical formulae represent complex semantic information in a concise form. Especially in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics, mathematical formulae are crucial to communicate information, e.g., in scientific papers, and to perform computations using computer algebra systems. Enabling computers to access the information encoded in mathematical formulae requires machine-readable formats that can represent both the presentation and content, i.e., the semantics, of formulae. Exchanging such information between systems additionally requires conversion methods for mathematical representation formats. We analyze how the semantic enrichment of formulae improves the format conversion process and show that considering the textual context of formulae reduces the error rate of such conversions. Our main contributions are: (1) providing an openly available benchmark dataset for the mathematical format conversion task consisting of a newly created test collection, an extensive, manually curated gold standard and task-specific evaluation metrics; (2) performing a quantitative evaluation of state-of-the-art tools for mathematical format conversions; (3) presenting a new approach that considers the textual context of formulae to reduce the error rate for mathematical format conversions. Our benchmark dataset facilitates future research on mathematical format conversions as well as research on many problems in mathematical information retrieval. Because we annotated and linked all components of formulae, e.g., identifiers, operators and other entities, to Wikidata entries, the gold standard can, for instance, be used to train methods for formula concept discovery and recognition. Such methods can then be applied to improve mathematical information retrieval systems, e.g., for semantic formula search, recommendation of mathematical content, or detection of mathematical plagiarism.},

Corresponding to word sense disambiguation in Natural Language Processing, we disambiguate mathematical identifiers. By regarding formulae and natural text as one monolithic information source, we are able to extract the semantics of identifiers in a process we term Mathematical Language Processing (MLP). As scientific communities tend to establish standard (identifier) notations, we use the document domain to infer the actual meaning of an identifier. Therefore, we adapt the software development concept of namespaces to mathematical notation. Thus, we learn namespace definitions by clustering the MLP results and mapping those clusters to subject classification schemata. In addition, this gives fundamental insights into the usage of mathematical notations in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Our gold standard based evaluation shows that MLP extracts relevant identifier-definitions. Moreover, we discover that identifier namespaces improve the performance of automated identifier-definition extraction, and elevate it to a level that cannot be achieved within the document context alone.},

In this work we propose a novel architecture that augments the standard sequence-to-sequence attentional model in two orthogonal ways. First, we use a hybrid pointer-generator network that can copy words from the source text via pointing, which aids accurate reproduction of information, while retaining the ability to produce novel words through the generator. Second, we use coverage to keep track of what has been summarized, which discourages repetition. We apply our model to the CNN / Daily Mail summarization task, outperforming the current abstractive state-of-the-art by at least 2 ROUGE points.},

  abstract = {While models have reached superhuman performance on popular question answering (QA) datasets such as SQuAD, they have yet to outperform humans on the task of question answering itself. In this paper, we investigate if models are learning reading comprehension from QA datasets by evaluating BERT-based models across five datasets. We evaluate models on their generalizability to out-of-domain examples, responses to missing or incorrect data, and ability to handle question variations. We find that no single dataset is robust to all of our experiments and identify shortcomings in both datasets and evaluation methods. Following our analysis, we make recommendations for building future QA datasets that better evaluate the task of question answering through reading comprehension. We also release code to convert QA datasets to a shared format for easier experimentation at https://github.com/amazon-research/qa-dataset-converter.},

  abstract = {The high performance of FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) in image processing applications is justified by its flexible reconfigurability, its inherent parallel nature and the availability of a large amount of internal memories. Lately, the Stochastic Computing (SC) paradigm has been found to be significantly advantageous in certain application domains including image processing because of its lower hardware complexity and power consumption. However, its viability is deemed to be limited due to its serial bitstream processing and excessive run-time requirement for convergence. To address these issues, a novel approach is proposed in this work where an energy-efficient implementation of SC is accomplished by introducing fast-converging Quasi-Stochastic Number Generators (QSNGs) and parallel stochastic bitstream processing, which are well suited to leverage FPGA's reconfigurability and abundant internal memory resources. The proposed approach has been tested on the Virtex-4 FPGA, and results have been compared with the serial and parallel implementations of conventional stochastic computation using the well-known SC edge detection and multiplication circuits. Results prove that by using this approach, execution time, as well as the power consumption are decreased by a factor of     3.5     and     4.5     for the edge detection circuit and multiplication circuit, respectively.},

However, these works have been conducted in isolation, without a unifying framework to organize efforts within the field. This leads to repetitive approaches, and puts an undue focus on the effects of bias, rather than on their origins. Research focused on bias symptoms rather than the underlying origins could limit the development of effective countermeasures. In this paper, we propose a unifying conceptualization: the predictive bias framework for NLP. We summarize the NLP literature and propose a general mathematical definition of predictive bias in NLP along with a conceptual framework, differentiating four main origins of biases: label bias, selection bias, model overamplification, and semantic bias. We discuss how past work has countered each bias origin. Our framework serves to guide an introductory overview of predictive bias in NLP, integrating existing work into a single structure and opening avenues for future research.},

  abstract = {Pre-trained general-purpose language models have been a dominating component in enabling real-world natural language processing (NLP) applications. However, a pre-trained model with backdoor can be a severe threat to the applications. Most existing backdoor attacks in NLP are conducted in the fine-tuning phase by introducing malicious triggers in the targeted class, thus relying greatly on the prior knowledge of the fine-tuning task. In this paper, we propose a new approach to map the inputs containing triggers directly to a predefined output representation of the pre-trained NLP models, e.g., a predefined output representation for the classification token in BERT, instead of a target label. It can thus introduce backdoor to a wide range of downstream tasks without any prior knowledge. Additionally, in light of the unique properties of triggers in NLP, we propose two new metrics to measure the performance of backdoor attacks in terms of both effectiveness and stealthiness. Our experiments with various types of triggers show that our method is widely applicable to different fine-tuning tasks (classification and named entity recognition) and to different models (such as BERT, XLNet, BART), which poses a severe threat. Furthermore, by collaborating with the popular online model repository Hugging Face, the threat brought by our method has been confirmed. Finally, we analyze the factors that may affect the attack performance and share insights on the causes of the success of our backdoor attack.},

Attention mechanisms have recently attracted enormous interest due to their highly parallelizable computation, significantly less training time, and flexibility in modeling dependencies. We propose a novel attention mechanism in which the attention between elements from input sequence(s) is directional and multi-dimensional (i.e., feature-wise). A light-weight neural net, "Directional Self-Attention Network (DiSAN)", is then proposed to learn sentence embedding, based solely on the proposed attention without any RNN/CNN structure. DiSAN is only composed of a directional self-attention with temporal order encoded, followed by a multi-dimensional attention that compresses the sequence into a vector representation. Despite its simple form, DiSAN outperforms complicated RNN models on both prediction quality and time efficiency. It achieves the best test accuracy among all sentence encoding methods and improves the most recent best result by 1.02\% on the Stanford Natural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, and shows state-of-the-art test accuracy on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST), Multi-Genre natural language inference (MultiNLI), Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge (SICK), Customer Review, MPQA, TREC question-type classification and Subjectivity (SUBJ) datasets.},

Due to the nature of mathematical texts, which often use domain specific vocabulary along with equations and math symbols, we posit that the development of a new BERT model for mathematics would be useful for many mathematical downstream tasks. In this resource paper, we introduce our multi-institutional effort (i.e., two learning platforms and three academic institutions in the US) toward this need: MathBERT, a model created by pre-training the BASE BERT model on a large mathematical corpus ranging from pre-kindergarten (pre-k), to high-school, to college graduate level mathematical content. In addition, we select three general NLP tasks that are often used in mathematics education: prediction of knowledge component, auto-grading open-ended Q\&A, and knowledge tracing, to demonstrate the superiority of MathBERT over BASE BERT. Our experiments show that MathBERT outperforms prior best methods by 1.2-22\% and BASE BERT by 2-8\% on these tasks. In addition, we build a mathematics specific vocabulary `mathVocab' to train with MathBERT. We discover that MathBERT pre-trained with `mathVocab' outperforms MathBERT trained with the BASE BERT vocabulary (i.e., `origVocab'). MathBERT is currently being adopted at the participated leaning platforms: Stride, Inc, a commercial educational resource provider, and ASSISTments.org, a free online educational platform. We release MathBERT for public usage at: https://github.com/tbs17/MathBERT.},

At the same time, the advancement in integration technologies have made the decade-old concept of coupling compute units close to the memory (called Near-Memory Computing) more viable. Processing right at the "home" of data can completely diminish the data movement problem of data-intensive applications. This paper focuses on analyzing and organizing the extensive body of literature on near-memory computing across various dimensions: starting from the memory level where this paradigm is applied, to the granularity of the application that could be executed on the near-memory units. We highlight the challenges as well as the critical need of evaluation methodologies that can be employed in designing these special architectures. Using a case study, we present our methodology and also identify topics for future research to unlock the full potential of near-memory computing.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are the heart of deep learning applications. Recent works PRIME [1] and ISAAC [2] demonstrated the promise of using resistive random access memory (ReRAM) to perform neural computations in memory. We found that training cannot be efficiently supported with the current schemes. First, they do not consider weight update and complex data dependency in training procedure. Second, ISAAC attempts to increase system throughput with a very deep pipeline. It is only beneficial when a large number of consecutive images can be fed into the architecture. In training, the notion of batch (e.g. 64) limits the number of images can be processed consecutively, because the images in the next batch need to be processed based on the updated weights. Third, the deep pipeline in ISAAC is vulnerable to pipeline bubbles and execution stall. In this paper, we present PipeLayer, a ReRAM-based PIM accelerator for CNNs that support both training and testing. We analyze data dependency and weight update in training algorithms and propose efficient pipeline to exploit inter-layer parallelism. To exploit intra-layer parallelism, we propose highly parallel design based on the notion of parallelism granularity and weight replication. With these design choices, PipeLayer enables the highly pipelined execution of both training and testing, without introducing the potential stalls in previous work.

It is suggested that specificity should be interpreted statistically, as a function of term use rather than of term meaning. The effects on retrieval of variations in term specificity are examined, experiments with three test collections showing in particular that frequently-occurring terms are required for good overall performance. It is argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches on frequent terms. Results for the test collections show that considerable improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure.},

The focus is on improving precision and recall in a MMIR system by optimally combining text and image similarity. Experiments are presented which demonstrate the utility of individual indexing systems in improving overall average precision.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new method for indexing and retrieving mathematical expressions, and a new protocol for evaluating math formula retrieval systems. The Tangent search engine uses an inverted index over pairs of symbols in math expressions. Each key in the index is a pair of symbols along with their relative distance and vertical displacement within an expression. Matched expressions are ranked by the harmonic mean of the percentage of symbol pairs matched in the query, and the percentage of symbol pairs matched in the candidate expression. We have found that our method is fast enough for use in real time and finds partial matches well, such as when subexpressions are re-arranged (e.g. expressions moved from the left to the right of an equals sign) or when individual symbols (e.g. variables) differ from a query expression. In an experiment using expressions from English Wikipedia, student and faculty participants (N=20) found expressions returned by Tangent significantly more similar than those from a text-based retrieval system (Lucene) adapted for mathematical expressions. Participants provided similarity ratings using a 5-point Likert scale, evaluating expressions from both algorithms one-at-a-time in a randomized order to avoid bias from the position of hits in search result lists. For the Lucenebased system, precision for the top 1 and 10 hits averaged 60\% and 39\% across queries respectively, while for Tangent mean precision at 1 and 10 were 99\% and 60\%. A demonstration and source code are publicly available.},

  abstract = {The paper gives a survey of the learning circuits which became known as learning matrices and some of their possible technological applications. The first section describes the principle of learning matrices. So-called conditioned connections between the characteristics of an object and the meaning of an object are formed in the learning phase. During the operation of connecting the characteristics of an object with its meaning (EB operation of the knowing phase) upon presenting the object characteristics, the associated most similar meaning is realized in the form of a signal by maximum likelihood decoding. Conversely, in operation from the meaning of an object to its characteristics (BE operation) the associated object characteristics are obtained as signals by parallel reading upon application of an object meaning. According to the characteristic signals processed (binary or analog signals) discrimination must be made between binary and nonbinary learning matrices. In the case of the binary learning matrix the conditioned connections are a statistical measure for the frequency of the coordination of object characteristics and object meaning, in the case of the nonbinary learning matrix they are a measure for an analog value proportional to a characteristic. Both types of matrices allow for the characteristic sets applied during EB operation to be unsystematically disturbed within limits. Moreover, the nonbinary learning matrix is invariant to systematic deviations between presented and learned characteristic sets (invariance to affine transformation, translation and rotated skewness).},

Our method uses a multilayered Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to map the input sequence to a vector of a fixed dimensionality, and then another deep LSTM to decode the target sequence from the vector. Our main result is that on an English to French translation task from the WMT-14 dataset, the translations produced by the LSTM achieve a BLEU score of 34.8 on the entire test set, where the LSTM's BLEU score was penalized on out-of-vocabulary words. Additionally, the LSTM did not have difficulty on long sentences. For comparison, a phrase-based SMT system achieves a BLEU score of 33.3 on the same dataset. When we used the LSTM to rerank the 1000 hypotheses produced by the aforementioned SMT system, its BLEU score increases to 36.5, which is close to the previous state of the art. The LSTM also learned sensible phrase and sentence representations that are sensitive to word order and are relatively invariant to the active and the passive voice. Finally, we found that reversing the order of the words in all source sentences (but not target sentences) improved the LSTM's performance markedly, because doing so introduced many short term dependencies between the source and the target sentence which made the optimization problem easier.},

Team members can have difficulty identifying the structure and salient elements of the wiki. This paper describes the design of WikiNavMap, an alternative visual representation for wikis, which provides an overview of the wiki structure. Based on analysis of student wikis, we identified factors that help team members identify which wiki pages are currently relevant to them. We hypothesised that a structural overview coupled with the visual representations of these factors could assist users with wiki navigation decisions. We report a preliminary evaluation with a large group wiki, created over a full university semester by a group of ten users. The results are promising for a small wiki but point to challenges in coping with the complexity of a larger one.},

  abstract = {Energy efficiency is the primary impediment in the path to exascale computing. Consequently, the high-performance computing community is increasingly interested in low-power high-performance embedded systems as building blocks for large-scale high-performance systems. The Adapteva Epiphany architecture integrates low-power RISC cores on a 2D mesh network and promises up to 70 GFLOPS/Watt of theoretical performance. However, with just 32\,KB of memory per eCore for storing both data and code, programming the Epiphany system presents significant challenges. In this paper we evaluate the performance of a 64-core Epiphany system with a variety of basic compute and communication micro-benchmarks. Further, we implemented two well known application kernels, 5-point star-shaped heat stencil with a peak performance of 65.2 GFLOPS and matrix multiplication with 65.3 GFLOPS in single precision across 64 Epiphany cores. We discuss strategies for implementing high-performance computing application kernels on such memory constrained low-power devices and compare the Epiphany with competing low-power systems. With future Epiphany revisions expected to house thousands of cores on a single chip, understanding the merits of such an architecture is of prime importance to the exascale initiative.},

While spintronic memories have demonstrated great promise due to their density, nonvolatility and low leakage, efforts to realize spintronic logic have been much less fruitful. Recent studies project the performance and energy efficiency of spintronic logic to be considerably inferior to CMOS. In this work, we explore Stochastic Computing (SC) as a new direction for the realization of energy-efficient logic using spintronic devices. We establish the synergy between stochastic computing and spintronics by demonstrating that (i) the peripheral circuits required for SC to convert to/from stochastic domains, which incur significant energy overheads in CMOS, can be efficiently realized by exploiting the characteristics of spintronic devices, and (ii) the low logic complexity and finegrained parallelism in SC circuits can be leveraged to alleviate the shortcomings of spintronic logic. We propose SPINTASTIC, a new design approach in which all the components of stochastic circuits \textemdash{} stochastic number generators, stochastic arithmetic units, and stochastic-to-binary converters \textemdash{} are realized using spintronic devices. Our experiments on a range of benchmarks from different application domains demonstrate that SPINTASTIC achieves 2.8X improvement in energy over CMOS stochastic implementations and 1.9X over a CMOS binary baseline.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new neural architecture to learn the conditional probability of an output sequence with elements that are discrete tokens corresponding to positions in an input sequence. Such problems cannot be trivially addressed by existent approaches such as sequence-to-sequence and Neural Turing Machines, because the number of target classes in each step of the output depends on the length of the input, which is variable. Problems such as sorting variable sized sequences, and various combinatorial optimization problems belong to this class. Our model solves the problem of variable size output dictionaries using a recently proposed mechanism of neural attention. It differs from the previous attention attempts in that, instead of using attention to blend hidden units of an encoder to a context vector at each decoder step, it uses attention as a pointer to select a member of the input sequence as the output. We call this architecture a Pointer Net (Ptr-Net). We show Ptr-Nets can be used to learn approximate solutions to three challenging geometric problems -- finding planar convex hulls, computing Delaunay triangulations, and the planar Travelling Salesman Problem -- using training examples alone. Ptr-Nets not only improve over sequence-to-sequence with input attention, but also allow us to generalize to variable size output dictionaries. We show that the learnt models generalize beyond the maximum lengths they were trained on. We hope our results on these tasks will encourage a broader exploration of neural learning for discrete problems.},

Effectiveness tends to derive from sophisticated ranking functions, such as those constructed using learning to rank, while efficiency gains tend to arise from improvements in query evaluation and caching strategies. Given their inherently disjoint nature, it is difficult to jointly optimize effectiveness and efficiency in end-to-end systems. To address this problem, we formulate and develop a novel cascade ranking model, which unlike previous approaches, can simultaneously improve both top k ranked effectiveness and retrieval efficiency. The model constructs a cascade of increasingly complex ranking functions that progressively prunes and refines the set of candidate documents to minimize retrieval latency and maximize result set quality. We present a novel boosting algorithm for learning such cascades to directly optimize the tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results show that our cascades are faster and return higher quality results than comparable ranking models.},

We propose an end-to-end neural architecture for the task. The architecture is based on match-LSTM, a model we proposed previously for textual entailment, and Pointer Net, a sequence-to-sequence model proposed by Vinyals et al.(2015) to constrain the output tokens to be from the input sequences. We propose two ways of using Pointer Net for our task.

In addition, we find that splitting articles into passages with the length of 100 words by sliding window improves performance by 4\%. By leveraging a passage ranker to select high-quality passages, multi-passage BERT gains additional 2\%. Experiments on four standard benchmarks showed that our multi-passage BERT outperforms all state-of-the-art models on all benchmarks.

Recently, the emerging metal-oxide resistive random access memory (RRAM) has shown its potential to design a PIM architecture. Several stateful logic operations, e.g., NOR and NAND, can be executed in parallel in an RRAM crossbar. Although previous works have designed some algorithms using the stateful logic, it is still under exploration how to fully exploit its potential high parallelism and design an asymptotically fast algorithm for a given function. In this work, we theoretically analyze the parallelism in an RRAM crossbar and design several asymptotically optimal arithmetic algorithms. In detail, we first propose the Single Instruction Multiple Lines (SIML) model to unify the stateful logic families and prove three lower bounds on the time complexity of a parallel RRAM algorithm. Then, we design three algorithms for integer addition functions with the stateful logic, guided by the lower bound analysis. All of them reach the time complexity lower bound. Finally, We make two extensions of the integer addition algorithms, supporting multiplication functions by decomposing them to additions and supporting the flex-point data type by proposing an exponent and mantissa update flow. Experimental evaluation shows that our integer algorithms achieves a speedup up to 13.79x over the previous RRAM algorithms. Our flex-point implementation achieves a 26.60x speedup and saves 73.68\% energy compared to an ARM.},

To address the challenge, this paper proposes an upgraded Mathematical Information Retrieval (MIR) system, namely WikiMirs 3.0, based on the context, structure and importance of formulae in a document. In WikiMirs 3.0, users can easily "cut" formulae and contexts from PDF documents as well as type in queries. Furthermore, a novel hybrid indexing and matching model is proposed to support both exact and fuzzy matching. In the hybrid model, both context and structure information of formulae are taken into consideration. In addition, the concept of formula importance within a document is introduced into the model for more reasonable ranking. Experimental results, compared with two classical MIR systems, demonstrate that the proposed system along with the novel model provides higher accuracy and better ranking results over Wikipedia.},

  abstract = {An e-graph efficiently represents a congruence relation over many expressions. Although they were originally developed in the late 1970s for use in automated theorem provers, a more recent technique known as equality saturation repurposes e-graphs to implement state-of-the-art, rewrite-driven compiler optimizations and program synthesizers. However, e-graphs remain unspecialized for this newer use case. Equality saturation workloads exhibit distinct characteristics and often require ad-hoc e-graph extensions to incorporate transformations beyond purely syntactic rewrites. This work contributes two techniques that make e-graphs fast and extensible, specializing them to equality saturation. A new amortized invariant restoration technique called rebuilding takes advantage of equality saturation's distinct workload, providing asymptotic speedups over current techniques in practice. A general mechanism called e-class analyses integrates domain-specific analyses into the e-graph, reducing the need for ad hoc manipulation. We implemented these techniques in a new open-source library called egg. Our case studies on three previously published applications of equality saturation highlight how egg's performance and flexibility enable state-of-the-art results across diverse domains.},

In this paper, we use adversarial training to mitigate this bias, introducing a hate speech classifier that learns to detect toxic sentences while demoting confounds corresponding to AAE texts.

Useful semantic information is available in bug reports and source code, but it is usually underutilized by existing bug localization approaches. Objective: To improve the performance of bug localization, we propose DeepLoc, a novel deep learning-based model that makes full use of semantic information. Method: DeepLoc is composed of an enhanced convolutional neural network (CNN) that considers bug-fixing recency and frequency, together with word-embedding and feature-detecting techniques. DeepLoc uses word embeddings to represent the words in bug reports and source files that retain their semantic information, and different CNNs to detect features from them. DeepLoc is evaluated on over 18,500 bug reports extracted from AspectJ, Eclipse, JDT, SWT, and Tomcat projects. Results: The experimental results show that DeepLoc achieves 10.87\%\textendash 13.4\% higher MAP (mean average precision) than conventional CNN. DeepLoc outperforms four current state-of-the-art approaches (DeepLocator, HyLoc, LR+WE, and BugLocator) in terms of Accuracy@k (the percentage of bug reports for which at least one real buggy file is located within the top k rank), MAP, and MRR (mean reciprocal rank) using less computation time. Conclusion: DeepLoc is capable of automatically connecting bug reports to the corresponding buggy files and achieves better performance than four state-of-the-art approaches based on a deep understanding of semantics in bug reports and source code.},

The emerging metal-oxide resistive random-access memory (RRAM) and RRAM crossbar have shown great potential on neuromorphic applications with high energy efficiency. However, the interfaces between analog RRAM crossbars and digital peripheral functions, namely Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) and Digital-to-Analog Converters (DACs), consume most of the area and energy of RRAM-based CNN design due to the large amount of intermediate data in CNN. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient structure for RRAM-based CNN. Based on the analysis of data distribution, a quantization method is proposed to transfer the intermediate data into 1 bit and eliminate DACs. An energy efficient structure using input data as selection signals is proposed to reduce the ADC cost for merging results of multiple crossbars. The experimental results show that the proposed method and structure can save 80\% area and more than 95\% energy while maintaining the same or comparable classification accuracy of CNN on MNIST.},

It has gained attention recently because of the very low area and power needs of its computing core. SC relies on stochastic number generators (SNGs) to map input binary numbers to stochastic bit streams. A conventional SNG comprises a random number source (RNS), typically an LFSR, and a comparator. It needs far more area and power than the SC core, offsetting the latter's main advantages. To mitigate this problem, SNGs employing emerging nanoscale devices such as memristors and spintronic devices have been proposed. However, these devices tend to have large errors in their output probabilities due to unpredictable variations in their fabrication processes and noise in their control signals. We present a novel method of exploiting such devices to design a highly accurate SNG. It is built around an RNS that generates uniformly distributed random numbers under ideal (nominal) conditions. It also has a novel error-cancelling probability conversion circuit (ECPCC) that guarantees very high accuracy in the output probability under realistic conditions when the RNS is subject to errors. An ECPCC can also be used to generate maximally correlated stochastic streams, a useful property for some applications.},

Using an extension of the correlated topic model, the context is generated from a mixture of latent topics, and the equation is generated by an RNN that depends on the latent topic activations. To experiment with this model, we create a corpus of 400K equation-context pairs extracted from a range of scientific articles from arXiv, and fit the model using a variational autoencoder approach. Experimental results show that this joint model significantly outperforms existing topic models and equation models for scientific texts. Moreover, we qualitatively show that the model effectively captures the relationship between topics and mathematics, enabling novel applications such as topic-aware equation generation, equation topic inference, and topic-aware alignment of mathematical symbols and words.},

  abstract = {Near-data in-storage processing research has been gaining momentum in recent years. Typical processing-in-storage architecture places a single or several processing cores inside the storage and allows data processing without transferring it to the host CPU. Since this approach replicates von Neumann architecture inside storage, it is exposed to the problems faced by von Neumann architecture, especially the bandwidth wall. We present a novel processing-in-storage system based on Resistive Content Addressable Memory (RCAM). RCAM functions simultaneously as a storage and a massively parallel associative processor. RCAM processing-in-storage resolves the bandwidth wall faced by conventional processing-in-storage architectures by keeping the computing inside the storage arrays, thus implementing indata, rather than near-data, processing. We show that RCAM based processing-in-storage architecture may outperform existing in-storage designs and accelerator based designs. RCAM processing-in-storage implementation of K-means achieves speedup of 4.6\textemdash 68 relative to CPU, GPU and FPGA based solutions. For K-Nearest Neighbors, RCAM processing-in-storage achieves speedup of 17.9\textemdash 17,470 and for Smith-Waterman sequence alignment it reaches speedup of almost 5 over a GPU cluster based solution.},

  abstract = {Nearly all of the recent mathematical literature, and much of the old literature, are online and mostly in natural-language form. Therefore, math content processing presents some of the same challenges faced in natural language processing (NLP), such as math disambiguation and math semantics determination. These challenges must be surmounted to enable more effective math knowledge management, math knowledge discovery, automated presentation-to-computation (P2C) conversion, and automated math reasoning. To meet this goal, considerable math language processing (MLP) technology is needed.This project aims to advance MLP by developing (1) a sophisticated part-of-math (POM) tagger, (2) math-sense disambiguation techniques along with supporting Machine-Learning (ML) based MLP algorithms, and (3) semantics extraction from, and enrichment of, math expressions. Specifically, the project first created an evolving tagset for math terms and expressions, and is developing a general-purpose POM tagger. The tagger works in several scans and interacts with other MLP algorithms that will be developed in this project. In the first scan of an input math document, each math term and some sub-expressions are tagged with two kinds of tags. The 1st1st1\^\textbackslash mathrm\{st\} kind consists of definite tags (such as operation, relation, numerator, etc.) that the tagger is certain of. The 2nd2nd2\^\textbackslash mathrm\{nd\} kind consists of alternative, tentative features (including alternative roles and meanings) drawn from a knowledge base that has been developed for this project. The 2nd2nd2\^\textbackslash mathrm\{nd\} and 3rd3rd3\^\textbackslash mathrm\{rd\} scan will, in conjunction with some NLP/ML-based algorithms, select the right features from among those alternative features, disambiguate the terms, group subsequences of terms into unambiguous sub-expressions and tag them, and thus derive definite unambiguous semantics of math terms and expressions. The NLP/ML-based algorithms needed for this work will be another part of this project. These include math topic modeling, math context modeling, math document classification (into various standard areas of math), and definition-harvesting algorithms.The project will create significant new concepts and techniques that will advance knowledge in two respects. First, the tagger, math disambiguation techniques, and NLP/ML-based algorithms, though they correspond to NLP and ML counterparts, will be quite novel because math expressions are radically different from natural language. Second, the project outcomes will enable the development of new advanced applications such as: (1) techniques for computer-aided semantic enrichment of digital math libraries; (2) automated P2C conversion of math expressions from natural form to (i) a machine-computable form and (ii) a formal form suitable for automated reasoning; (3) math question-answering capabilities at the manuscript level and collection level; (4) richer math UIs; and (5) more accurate math optical character recognition.},

Using a Symbol Layout Tree representation for formula appearance, we propose the Maximum Subtree Similarity (MSS) for ranking formulae based upon the subexpression whose symbols and layout best match a query formula. Because MSS is too expensive to apply against a complete collection, the Tangent-3 system first retrieves expressions using an inverted index over symbol pair relationships, ranking hits using the Dice coefficient; the top-k formulae are then re-ranked by MSS. Tangent-3 obtains state-of-the-art performance on the NTCIR-11 Wikipedia formula retrieval benchmark, and is efficient in terms of both space and time. Retrieval systems for other graphical forms, including chemical diagrams, flowcharts, figures, and tables, may benefit from adopting this approach.},

Enabled by emerging nonvolatile memory, i.e., RRAM and its monolithic 3D integration, IMEC can be configured into one or a combination of four distinct functions, 1) logic, 2) ternary content addressable memory, 3) memory, and 4) interconnect. Thus, IMEC exploits a continuum of PIM capabilities across the whole spectrum, ranging from 0 percent (pure data storage) to 100 percent (pure compute engine), or intermediate states in between. IMEC can be modularly integrated into the DDRx memory subsystem, communicating with processors by the ordinary DRAM commands. Additionally, to reduce the programming burden, we provide a complete framework to compile applications written in high-level programming language (e.g., OpenCL) onto IMEC. This framework also enables code portability across different platforms for heterogeneous computing. By using this framework, several benchmarks are mapped onto IMEC for evaluating its performance, energy and resource utilization. The simulation results show that, IMEC reduces the energy consumption by 99.6 percent, and achieves \$644\textbackslash times\$ speedup, compared to a baseline CPU system. We further compare IMEC with FPGA architecture, and demonstrate that the performance improvement is not simply obtained by replacing SRAM cells with denser RRAM cells.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data, including web pages, news articles, scientific literature, emails, enterprise documents, and social media such as blog articles, forum posts, product reviews, and tweets. This has led to an increasing demand for powerful software tools to help people analyze and manage vast amounts of text data effectively and efficiently. Unlike data generated by a computer system or sensors, text data are usually generated directly by humans, and are accompanied by semantically rich content. As such, text data are especially valuable for discovering knowledge about human opinions and preferences, in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text. In contrast to structured data, which conform to well-defined schemas (thus are relatively easy for computers to handle), text has less explicit structure, requiring computer processing toward understanding of the content encoded in text. The current technology of natural language processing has not yet reached a point to enable a computer to precisely understand natural language text, but a wide range of statistical and heuristic approaches to analysis and management of text data have been developed over the past few decades. They are usually very robust and can be applied to analyze and manage text data in any natural language, and about any topic.  This book provides a systematic introduction to all these approaches, with an emphasis on covering the most useful knowledge and skills required to build a variety of practically useful text information systems. The focus is on text mining applications that can help users analyze patterns in text data to extract and reveal useful knowledge. Information retrieval systems, including search engines and recommender systems, are also covered as supporting technology for text mining applications. The book covers the major concepts, techniques, and ideas in text data mining and information retrieval from a practical viewpoint, and includes many hands-on exercises designed with a companion software toolkit (i.e., MeTA) to help readers learn how to apply techniques of text mining and information retrieval to real-world text data and how to experiment with and improve some of the algorithms for interesting application tasks. The book can be used as a textbook for a computer science undergraduate course or a reference book for practitioners working on relevant problems in analyzing and managing text data.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the CNNs have achieved great successes in the image processing tasks, e.g., image recognition and object detection. Unfortunately, traditional CNN's classification is found to be easily misled by increasingly complex image features due to the usage of pooling operations, hence unable to preserve accurate position and pose information of the objects. To address this challenge, a novel neural network structure called Capsule Network has been proposed, which introduces equivariance through capsules to significantly enhance the learning ability for image segmentation and object detection. Due to its requirement of performing a high volume of matrix operations, CapsNets have been generally accelerated on modern GPU platforms that provide highly optimized software library for common deep learning tasks. However, based on our performance characterization on modern GPUs, CapsNets exhibit low efficiency due to the special program and execution features of their routing procedure, including massive unshareable intermediate variables and intensive synchronizations, which are very difficult to optimize at software level. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid computing architecture design named \textbackslash textit\{PIM-CapsNet\}. It preserves GPU's on-chip computing capability for accelerating CNN types of layers in CapsNet, while pipelining with an off-chip in-memory acceleration solution that effectively tackles routing procedure's inefficiency by leveraging the processing-in-memory capability of today's 3D stacked memory. Using routing procedure's inherent parallellization feature, our design enables hierarchical improvements on CapsNet inference efficiency through minimizing data movement and maximizing parallel processing in memory.},

  abstract = {Driven by recent advances in resistive random-access memory (RRAM), there have been growing interests in exploring alternative computing concept, i.e., in-memory processing, to address the classical von Neumann bottlenecks. Despite of their great promise in improving performance and energy efficiency, most existing works are built on the inherent matrix-vector multiplication capability of RRAM crossbar structure, and thus lack the flexibility to adapt to future market/technology induced changes in data-intensive applications. To address these challenges, we propose an in-memory reconfigurable architecture based on RRAM crossbar structure. For the first time, it achieves a full programmability across computation and storage, and thereby provides more flexibilities of partitioning the hardware resources based on applications' needs. We further develop two complete CAD design flows to facilitate development of applications written in hardware description languages (HDLs) for our architecture, based on: 1) adaption from existing tool set developed for FPGA, 2) a custom tool design optimized towards the new architecture. Our experiments show that, both design flows are effective in exploiting flexible resources offered by our architecture and thus achieves better efficiency than state-of-art FPGAs (30\% improvement in performance with 66\% reduction in area). In addition, compared to adapted design flow, our custom design flow achieves speedup by 3.3\texttimes, and further improves mapping quality.},

Our method provides (1) a simple indexing scheme using OPT leaf-root paths, (2) practical matching of the K largest common subexpressions, and (3) scoring matched OPT subtrees by counting nodes corresponding to visible symbols, weighting operators lower than operands. Using the largest common subexpression (K = 1), we outperform existing formula search engines for non-wildcard queries on the NTCIR-12 Wikipedia Formula Browsing Task. Stronger results are obtained when using additional subexpressions for scoring. Without parallelization or pruning, our system has practical execution times with low variance when compared to other state-of-the-art formula search engines.},

Convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) are two mainstream architectures for such modeling tasks, which adopt totally different ways of understanding natural languages. In this work, we combine the strengths of both architectures and propose a novel and unified model called C-LSTM for sentence representation and text classification. C-LSTM utilizes CNN to extract a sequence of higher-level phrase representations, and are fed into a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (LSTM) to obtain the sentence representation. C-LSTM is able to capture both local features of phrases as well as global and temporal sentence semantics. We evaluate the proposed architecture on sentiment classification and question classification tasks. The experimental results show that the C-LSTM outperforms both CNN and LSTM and can achieve excellent performance on these tasks.},

In contrast, most NLU models above the word level are designed for a specific task and struggle with out-of-domain data. If we aspire to develop models with understanding beyond the detection of superficial correspondences between inputs and outputs, then it is critical to develop a unified model that can execute a range of linguistic tasks across different domains. To facilitate research in this direction, we present the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE, gluebenchmark.com): a benchmark of nine diverse NLU tasks, an auxiliary dataset for probing models for understanding of specific linguistic phenomena, and an online platform for evaluating and comparing models. For some benchmark tasks, training data is plentiful, but for others it is limited or does not match the genre of the test set. GLUE thus favors models that can represent linguistic knowledge in a way that facilitates sample-efficient learning and effective knowledge-transfer across tasks. While none of the datasets in GLUE were created from scratch for the benchmark, four of them feature privately-held test data, which is used to ensure that the benchmark is used fairly. We evaluate baselines that use ELMo (Peters et al., 2018), a powerful transfer learning technique, as well as state-of-the-art sentence representation models. The best models still achieve fairly low absolute scores. Analysis with our diagnostic dataset yields similarly weak performance over all phenomena tested, with some exceptions.",
