\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, we develop a framework to represent mathematical expressions in a continuous vector space. We show that a sequence-to-sequence model can be trained to generate expressions that are mathematically equivalent to the input, and the encoder of this model can be used to generate vector representations of mathematical expressions. We perform quantitative and qualitative experiments and demonstrate that these representations encode the semantics and not just the syntactic structure. Our experiments also show that these representations perform better at grouping similar expressions together and analogy tasks compared to the representations generated by an autoencoder. We discuss limitations and future work of our approach in Section \ref{sec:limitations}.
