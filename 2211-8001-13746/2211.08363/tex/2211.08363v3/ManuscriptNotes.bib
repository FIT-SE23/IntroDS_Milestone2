@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="In reality the magnetic field should satisfy $\protect \frac  {\partial B_y}{\partial y} + \protect \frac  {\partial B_z}{\partial z} = 0$. So there should be an inhomogeneous component in the $y$ direction too. In addition there should be a homogeneous component in the $z$ direction. Since these are of no consequence in the dynamics of the particle in the Stern-Gerlach experiment, we ignore them in the analysis here."}
