  abstract = {Most general third-order 3d linear gauge vector field theory is considered. The field equations involve, besides the mass, two dimensionless constant parameters. The theory admits two-parameter series of conserved tensors with the canonical energy-momentum being a particular representative of the series. For a certain range of the model parameters, the series of conserved tensors include bounded quantities. This makes the dynamics classically stable, though the canonical energy is unbounded in all the instances. The free third-order equations are shown to admit constrained multi-Hamiltonian form with the 00-components of conserved tensors playing the roles of corresponding Hamiltonians. The series of Hamiltonians includes the canonical Ostrogradski���s one, which is unbounded. The Hamiltonian formulations with different Hamiltonians are not connected by canonical transformations. This means, the theory admits inequivalent quantizations at the free level. Covariant interactions are included with spinor fields such that the higher-derivative dynamics remains stable at interacting level if the bounded conserved quantity exists in the free theory. In the first-order formalism, the interacting theory remains Hamiltonian and therefore it admits quantization, though the vertices are not necessarily Lagrangian in the third-order field equations.},

  abstract  = {Many problems in the sciences and engineering can be rephrased as optimization problems on matrix search spaces endowed with a so-called manifold structure. This book shows how to exploit the special structure of such problems to develop efficient numerical algorithms. It places careful emphasis on both the numerical formulation of the algorithm and its differential geometric abstraction--illustrating how good algorithms draw equally from the insights of differential geometry, optimization, and numerical analysis. Two more theoretical chapters provide readers with the background in differential geometry necessary to algorithmic development. In the other chapters, several well-known optimization methods such as steepest descent and conjugate gradients are generalized to abstract manifolds. The book provides a generic development of each of these methods, building upon the material of the geometric chapters. It then guides readers through the calculations that turn these geometrically formulated methods into concrete numerical algorithms. The state-of-the-art algorithms given as examples are competitive with the best existing algorithms for a selection of eigenspace problems in numerical linear algebra. Optimization Algorithms on Matrix Manifolds offers techniques with broad applications in linear algebra, signal processing, data mining, computer vision, and statistical analysis. It can serve as a graduate-level textbook and will be of interest to applied mathematicians, engineers, and computer scientists.},

  abstract    = {State of the art trajectory generation schemes for quadrotors assume a simple dynamic model. They neglect aerodynamic effects such as induced drag and blade flapping and assume that no wind is present. In order to overcome this limitation, this thesis investigates a trajectory optimization scheme based upon Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). There are various software-implementations of the DDP scheme. For future deployment on robotic hardware the software is required to be computationally efficient and to be open-source. The C++ template-based optimization library named GCOP developed at JHU was deemed suitable so it was selected for this purpose. Before implementing the solver, a full model of the Crazyflie Nano Quadcopter is identified experimentally. The model considers a first order term for the aerodynamic forces in each axis of the body frame. The solver is validated, normalized and the performance is benchmarked. This method yields reliable minimum control-effort trajectories. The computation time required to reach the optimum solution is studied for different dicretizations, and for different choices of solver parameters. A control scheme is proposed and studied in Monte-Carlo simulations. It is robust and able to handle large modelling errors in mass and moment of inertia while ensuring minimal error on the final state.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a general passivity-based framework for the control of flexible joint robots. Recent results on torque, position, as well as impedance control of flexible joint robots are summarized, and the relations between the individual contributions are highlighted. It is shown that an inner torque feedback loop can be incorporated into a passivity-based analysis by interpreting torque feedback in terms of shaping of the motor inertia. This result, which implicitly was already included in earlier work on torque and position control, can also be used for the design of impedance controllers. For impedance control, furthermore, potential energy shaping is of special interest. It is shown how, based only on the motor angles, a potential function can be designed which simultaneously incorporates gravity compensation and a desired Cartesian stiffness relation for the link angles. All the presented controllers were experimentally evaluated on DLR lightweight robots and their performance and robustness shown with respect to uncertain model parameters. Experimental results with position controllers as well as an impact experiment are presented briefly, and an overview of several applications is given in which the controllers have been applied.},

  abstract = {A robotic system for object recognition is described that uses passive stereo vision and active exploratory tactile sensing. The complementary nature of these sensing modalities allows the system to discover the underlying 3-D structure of the objects to be recognized. This structure is embodied in rich, hierarchical, viewpoint-independent 3-D models of the objects which include curved surfaces, concavities and holes. The vision processing provides sparse 3-D data about regions of interest that are then actively explored by the tactile sensor mounted on the end of a six-degree-of-freedom manipulator. A robust, hierarchical procedure has been developed to inte grate the visual and tactile data into accurate 3-D surface and feature primitives. This integration of vision and touch provides geometric measures of the surfaces and features that are used in a matching phase to find model objects that are consistent with the sensory data. Methods for verification of the hypothesis are presented, including the sensing of visually occluded areas with the tactile sensor. A number of experi ments have been performed using real sensors and real, noisy data to demonstrate the utility of these methods and the ability of such a system to recognize objects that would be difficult for a system using vision alone.},

We first recover a result of Buzzi and Lamb showing that the equilibrium point is contained in a three dimensional conical subspace which consists of a two parameter family of periodic solutions with symmetry R, and furthermore that there may or may not exist two families of non-symmetric periodic solutions, depending on the coefficients of the Hamiltonian (correcting a minor error in their paper). In the second problem we study an equivariant Hamiltonian system with a symmetry S that acts anti-symplectically. Generically, there is no S-symmetric solution in a neighbourhood of the equilibrium point. Moreover, we prove the existence of at least 2 and at most 12 families of non-symmetric periodic solutions. We conclude with a brief study of systems with both forms of symmetry, showing they have very similar structure to the system with symmetry R.},

  abstract      = {Benefiting from modularity, cable-driven parallel robots (CDPRs) are capable of being reconfigurable by changes in their attachment points and, therefore, significant changes in their kinematic structures. Due to their wide-range motion, measuring CDPRs' fixed attachment points location can be limiting. This paper tackles the problem of identifying the manipulators' geometry based on their interoceptive sensors by reinforcement learning. We propose using Jacobian matrix elements to map rewards and actions into joint space without the appearance of local minimums and multiple solutions of forward kinematics. Feasibility of this method is demonstrated by a planar redundant CDPR.Without an expensive tracking system, the robot is capable of autocalibration based on the cable length measurements (actuator feedback) and quantization factors of any configuration space, while keeping all the cables under tension force. For instance, if the workspace is discretized with a grid resolution of 1 cm, this algorithm is capable of reducing the initial error of 2.2 m, as low as 1 cm. Further extension of this method toward higher technology readiness levels can improve the possibility of commercializing these manipulators toward plug-and-play setups. © 2018 IEEE.},

The NSB is a behavior-based robot control approach that uses a hierarchical organization of the tasks to guarantee that they are executed according to a desired priority: it uses a projection technique to avoid that, in the absence of actuator saturations, low-priority tasks could influence higher-priority tasks. The main contribution of this paper is the extension of the NSB approach to the case where actuator velocity saturation bounds are explicitly taken into account. The proposed solution dynamically scales task velocity commands so that the hierarchy of task priorities is preserved in spite of actuator velocity saturations. The approach has been validated on two specific case studies. In the first case, the NSB elaborates the motion directives for a single mobile robot that has to reach a target while avoiding a point obstacle1 in this case, the mission is composed of two tasks. In the second case, the NSB elaborates the motion directives for a team of six mobile robots that has orates the motion directives for a team of six mobile robots that has to entrap and escort a target1 in this case the mission is composed of four tasks. The approach is validated by numerical simulations and by experiments with real mobile robots.},

  abstract        = {Contrary to the inverse kinematics, the forward kinematics of parallel manipulators involves solving highly non-linear equations and provides more than one feasible end-effector pose, which are called the assembly modes, for a given set of link lengths or joint angles. Out of the multiple feasible solutions, only one solution can be achieved from a certain initial configuration. Therefore, in this paper, the Kohonen's self-organizing map (SOM) is proposed to learn and classify the multiple solution branches of the forward kinematics and then provide a unique real-time solution among the assembly modes. Each solution of the multiple feasible ones is coded using IF-THEN rules based on the values of the passive joint variables. Due to not only the classification but also the associative memory learning abilities of the SOM, the passive joint variables vector, the end-effector pose vector, and this class code are associated with the active joint variables vector constituting the input vector to the SOM in the offline learning phase. In the online testing phase, only the active joint variables vector and the class code are fed to the SOM to obtain the unique end-effector pose vector. The Jacobian matrix calculated at the SOM output layer is used for further fine tuning this output to obtain an accurate end-effector pose vector. Simulations are conducted for 3-RPR and 3-RRR planar parallel manipulators to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results proved high accuracy of the desired unique solution in real-time. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.},

  abstract = {Flexible and reconfigurable robotic systems can minimize the manual effort by providing planning algorithms to react to changing requirements. An important part of the planning process is the initial design of a robotic workcell layout. The components require to be arranged in such a way that each task is reachable by the manipulator and no collisions occur. If the execution area is limited in size, several robots are involved or the tasks are complex, planning a suitable workcell layout becomes a challenging problem. In this work, we present a framework which suggests appropriate workcell layouts by analyzing the kinematic properties of tasks and workcell components such as storages and robots. We formulate a constrained nonlinear optimization problem on discrete parameter sets to optimize the layout regarding the placement of the components. The general framework provides an interface to optimize multiple objectives. In particular, we analyze the maximization of the region in the workspace in which a task could be executed. Constraints guarantee the absence of collisions and the reachability of each task. The framework is evaluated for three scenarios, where two robots have to cooperate to insert a slot-nut into an aluminum profile. The optimization problems are solved by three optimization algorithms, namely the pure random search, hill climb and genetic algorithm, where the genetic algorithm has slightly outperformed the others. A feasible layout has been found within milliseconds. The presented approach provides a powerful framework to optimize the layout of a robotic workcell for flexible systems with multiple tasks, storages and robots.},

The complexity of a reachability analysis increases when the setup is reconfigurable or consists of multiple robots sharing the same workspace.  In this work we show an approach to decouple task-specifications from system-wide configurations to compute task-specific workspace maps. These maps area powerful tool for designing and planning robotic tasks, since they allow to visualize and suggest feasible poses for task execution. Furthermore, the maps can be queried during runtime to select appropriate poses automatically. Specifying a task manually takes time and effort since it is necessary to define a set of transformations with respect to a task reference frame. To overcome this issue, we show a solution by recording the motion of a robot to generate a task specification.

Due to its local nature, the moderate cost of the solution allows this architecture to run within an interactive environment.

Consequently, the usable workspace of the manipulator is effectively reduced. It has been proposed that high joint speeds could be avoided by introducing redundant joints and using an appropriate kinematic inversion algorithm. For a very general class of kinematic inversion algorithms, the theorems of this paper state some fundamental relations between the properties of the algorithm and its ability to resolve these problems. These results have practical implications in the design of controllers for redundant manipulators, especially when real-time sensory input is used to modify the manipulator's trajectory.},

This concept was implemented in a multibody simulation of a five-bar linkage by using numerical optimization to find the required spring constants as well as the trajectory that minimize the torque on the motors. The required energy of the system using the concept of natural motion was compared with that of a typical trajectory, finding that the use of springs and natural motion reduces the energy consumption by 68 {\%} per cycle.},

  title    = {An Algorithm to Determine the Self-Motion Manifold of a Robotic System Consisting of a DLR Lightweight Robot and Linear Axis},
  year     = {2016},
  abstract = {In order to achieve dexterous manipulation and interaction in dynamic environments, robots that were desired for human-robot interaction commonly have more degrees of freedom (DOFs) than typical industrial robots. In addition to fulfilling a primary task, the redundant DOFs can be exploited to achieve various secondary goals, e.g. the avoidance of obstacles or the minimization of certain cost functions. In general, it is beneficial to analyze (if possible) possible self-motions of the robot to develop suitable null space control strategies. In this bachelor thesis, an algorithm is developed to determine the self-motion manifold of a robotic system, which consists of a 7-DOF revolute-jointed lightweight robot that is augmented by a linear axis. In the algorithm two independent self-motions, obtained by orthogonal null space velocities, are numerically integrated over time which results in trajectories along the self-motion manifold surface. The end-effector position error of the generated grid is analyzed in detail and a correction term to decrease this error and remove the integration drift is proposed. Furthermore, a controller for the self-motion manifold coordinates is embedded into Cartesian impedance control framework. To ensure the best possible decoupling, null space projections are constructed such that the images are orthogonal sets. Finally, two applications for the null space controller and the self-motion manifold grid are implemented and experimentally verified.},

  title    = {Evaluation of Haptic Collision Feedback and Haptic Guidance for Robotic Teleoperation},
  year     = {2021},
  month    = {November},
  abstract = {Introduction: Haptic shared control approaches have been associated with increased performance, while avoiding well-known drawbacks of high automation levels (e.g. out-of-theloop phenomena), as both the human and the automated system can exert forces on the control interface, enabling a continuous interaction between the automated system and the operator.
However, little is currently known about the influence of haptic guidance on performance and user experience, especially under varying cognitive load conditions. Method: 26 participants completed an obstacle avoidance-, and a peg-in-hole task in a virtual environment using a seven degrees of freedom haptic device. It was differentiated between three different haptic guidance types and three distinct degrees of guidance stiffness. Moreover, cognitive load was manipulated using a secondary task paradigm. Results: The results indicated that haptic constraints do indeed improve performance by reducing the duration of the task and the distance from the ideal trajectory. Additionally, for the obstacle avoidance task, fewer collisions and lower collision
forces could be demonstrated. The best results were obtained with a medium or high degree of stiffness. Whereas especially guidance aiding the user with the positioning of the peg was
performance-enhancing with regard to the obstacle avoidance task. Yet for the peg-in-hole task, aiding the operator with the orientation of the peg was most beneficial. Even though haptic
constraints remained effective when additional cognitive load was imposed on the user, they generally did not significantly reduced the resulting performance degrading effects. However,
haptic guidance was associated with a workload reduction and higher usefulness ratings than manual control. Overall, high enjoyment ratings were evident for all conditions. Yet, a partial
trade-off could be observed between the performance-enhancing effects of haptic guidance and feelings of control and responsibility},

The k-d tree is defined and examples are given. It is shown to be quite efficient in its storage requirements. A significant advantage of this structure is that a single data structure can handle many types of queries very efficiently. Various utility algorithms are developed; their proven average running times in an n record file are: insertion, O(log n); deletion of the root, O(n(k-1)/k); deletion of a random node, O(log n); and optimization (guarantees logarithmic performance of searches), O(n log n). Search algorithms are given for partial match queries with t keys specified [proven maximum running time of O(n(k-t)/k)] and for nearest neighbor queries [empirically observed average running time of O(log n).] These performances far surpass the best currently known algorithms for these tasks. An algorithm is presented to handle any general intersection query. The main focus of this paper is theoretical. It is felt, however, that k-d trees could be quite useful in many applications, and examples of potential uses are given.},

  abstract = {We present a manipulation planning framework that allows robots to plan in the presence of constraints on end-effector pose, as well as other common constraints. The framework has three main components: constraint representation, constraint-satisfaction strategies, and a general planning algorithm. These components come together to create an efficient and probabilistically complete manipulation planning algorithm called the Constrained BiDirectional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) – CBiRRT2. The underpinning of our framework for pose constraints is our Task Space Regions (TSRs) representation. TSRs are intuitive to specify, can be efficiently sampled, and the distance to a TSR can be evaluated very quickly, making them ideal for sampling-based planning. Most importantly, TSRs are a general representation of pose constraints that can fully describe many practical tasks. For more complex tasks, such as manipulating articulated objects, TSRs can be chained together to create more complex end-effector pose constraints. TSRs can also be intersected, a property that we use to plan with pose uncertainty. We provide a detailed description of our framework, prove probabilistic completeness for our planning approach, and describe several real-world example problems that illustrate the efficiency and versatility of the TSR framework.},

The novel implicit treatment also yields an order of magnitude speedup in our elastic rod dynamics.},

  title    = {Robust Visual Servo Control and Tracking for the Manipulator of a Planetary Exploration Rover},
  year     = {2021},
  month    = {June},
  abstract = {To collect samples and handle tools, planetary exploration rovers commonly employ light-weight robotic manipulators. These can suffer from undesirable positioning imprecision due to erroneous end-effector pose estimates obtained by the manipulators kinematics, leading to the failure of the manipulation task.
This thesis presents a vision-based end-effector pose correction pipeline to improve the positioning precision of the end-effector during manipulation tasks. Our approach corrects the end-effector pose by fusing the estimates obtained by the manipulators kinematics with information obtained from monocular vision data.
We propose a gradient based method to track a set of active markers within the image stream, which provides us with additional information on the covariance of the retrieved image points. In order to recover the 3D pose estimate of the end-effector, we make use of the maximum likelihood perspective-n-point algorithm, allowing us to propagate the image point uncertainties to their 3D pose covariances. Based on evaluations using recorded ground-truth data, we show that our tracking method leads to a reduction of the kinematic position error by up to 77\%.
To operate outdoors and under changing illumination conditions, the robustness of the tracking approach is paramount. Based on the propagated covariance information, we employ an Error-State Kalman filter for the rejection of pose outliers and the reduction of pose jitter. Its smoothing capabilities are confirmed in simulation. We further show the application of the vision-based correction pipeline as part of a visual servoing scheme designed for the collection of payload boxes by the manipulator of the Lightweight Rover Unit 2, developed at the Institute for Robotics and Mechatronics of the German Aerospace Center. We propose a switching control scheme that applies a position-based visual servo (PBVS) for movements of the end-effector in free space and switches to a PBVS based hybrid impedance visual servoing scheme for movements in close proximity or in direct contact with the coupling partner, to ensure the safe interaction between the manipulator and the payload.
The implemented PBVS approach is lastly evaluated in simulation. We show its successful execution and stability in the vicinity of singularities as well as the avoidance of joint
position and velocity limits.},

A skeleton representation is utilized to represent the topological structure which is further used to create a weighted graph for deciding the merging of curve segments. Different to existing approaches which utilize local shape information near intersections, our method considers shape characteristics of curve segments in a larger scope and is thus capable of giving more satisfactory results.

The optimization problem is defined upon spline interpolation methods, using piecewise polynomial functions to produce a trajectory passing through a sequence of via-points, and on the electromechanical model of the robot. The formulation introduced in this work is aimed at estimating and optimizing the energy consumption using closed-form expressions and therefore without the need for any numerical integration of the robot dynamics. The method accounts for kinematic constraints on speed, acceleration, and jerk, as well as constraints due to the limitations of the power supply and of the regenerated energy storage system.},

  abstract        = {The forward kinematic problem of parallel manipulators is resolved using a holographic neural paradigm. In a holographic neural model, stimulus-response (input-output) associations are transformed from the domain of real numbers to the domain of complex vectors. An element of information within the holographic neural paradigm has a semantic content represented by phase information and a confidence level assigned in the magnitude of the complex scalar. Networks are trained on a database generated from the closed-form inverse kinematic solutions. After the learning phase, the networks are tested on trajectories which were not part of the training data. The simulation results, given for a planar three-degree-of-freedom parallel manipulator with revolute joints and for a spherical three-degree-of-freedom parallel manipulator, show that holographic neural network models are feasible to solve the forward kinematic problem of parallel manipulators. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We explore a research methodology which emphasizes ongoing physical interaction with the environment as the primary source of constraint on the design of intelligent systems. We show how this methodology has recently had significant successes on a par with the most successful classical efforts. We outline plausible future work along these lines which can lead to vastly more ambitious systems.},

Relying on the geometry of mechanical systems on manifolds, we propose a design algorithm for the tracking problem. The notions of error function and transport map lead to a proper definition of configuration and velocity error. These are the crucial ingredients in designing a proportional derivative feedback and feedforward controller. The proposed approach includes as special cases a variety of results on control of manipulators, pointing devices and autonomous vehicles. Our design provides particular insight into both aerospace and underwater applications where the configuration manifold is a Lie group.},

  abstract  = {Energy efficiency is an important goal of robotic design, especially within the framework of Industry 4.0. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to reduce the energy consumption and is then demonstrated on a two-degree-of-freedom parallel robot (i.e. a Delta-2 robot) performing cyclic pick-and-place operations of a predefined trajectory. We define a mixed approach as a methodology that exploits two kinds of energy reducing systems: springs for storing elastic energy and capacitors for recovering braking energy. Using an optimization-based design methodology, two torsional springs with optimum stiffness values are coupled with energy-recuperating drive axles, leading to a reduction of motor torque required. Results show that this approach allows for a significant reduction in energy expenditure.},

  abstract = {This paper is a review of results which have been recently obtained by applying mathematical concepts drawn, in particular, from differential geometry and topology, to the physics of Hamiltonian dynamical systems with many degrees of freedom of interest for statistical mechanics. The first part of the paper concerns the applications of methods used in classical differential geometry to study the chaotic dynamics of Hamiltonian systems. Starting from the identity between the trajectories of a dynamical system and the geodesics in its configuration space, when equipped with a suitable metric, a geometric theory of chaotic dynamics can be developed, which sheds new light on the origin of chaos in Hamiltonian systems. In fact, it appears that chaos can be induced not only by negative curvatures, as was originally surmised, but also by positive curvatures, provided the curvatures are fluctuating along the geodesics. In the case of a system with a large number of degrees of freedom it is possible to approximate the chaotic instability behaviour of the dynamics by means of a geometric model independent of the dynamics, which allows then an analytical estimate of the largest Lyapunov exponent in terms of the averages and fluctuations of the curvature of the configuration space of the system. In the second part of the paper the phenomenon of phase transitions is addressed and it is here that topology comes into play. In fact, when a system undergoes a phase transition, the fluctuations of the configuration-space curvature, when plotted as a function of either the temperature or the energy of the system, exhibit a singular behaviour at the phase transition point, which can be qualitatively reproduced using geometric models. In these models the origin of the singular behaviour of the curvature fluctuations appears to be caused by a topological transition in configuration space, which corresponds to the phase transition of the physical system. This leads us to put forward a topological hypothesis (TH). The content of the TH is that phase transitions would be related at a deeper level to a change in the topology of the configuration space of the system. We will illustrate this on a simple model, the mean-field XY model, where the TH can be checked directly and analytically. Since this model is of a rather special nature, namely a mean-field model with infinitely ranged interactions, we discuss other more realistic (non-mean-field-like) models, which cannot be solved analytically, but which do supply direct supporting evidence for the TH via numerical simulations.},

In general, the word chaos may refer to any state of confusion or disorder and it may also refer to mythology or philosophy.

In this article we analyze the deterministic chaos theory, a branch of mathematics and physics that deals with dynamical systems (nonlinear differential equations or mappings) with very peculiar properties. Fundamental concepts of the deterministic chaos theory are briefly analyzed and some illustrative examples of conservative and dissipative chaotic motions are introduced. Complementarily, we studied in details the chaotic motion of some dynamical systems described by differential equations and mappings. Relations between chaotic, stochastic and turbulent phenomena are also commented.},

There are some special cases where, because of symmetry restrictions, a bush is ���irreducible��� ��� it contains modes associated with a single irrep only. We looked for all irreducible bushes of vibrational modes for N-particle mechanical systems with the symmetry of any of the 230 space groups and, for the case of analytical potentials, found that there exist only 19 classes of such bushes. As a result, all modal subspaces to which symmetry determined similar non-linear normal modes (introduced by Rosenberg) belong, were found, as well as all analytical mechanical systems whose dynamics, with a certain mode being initially excited, strictly reduces to only one resonance subspace corresponding to a single irrep. We found that the dimensionality of such resonance subspaces does not exceed four.},

First, all of the joint variables are chosen to set up a generalized local coordinate system for the product of the positional space and the orientational one. Second, by defining a new Riemannian metric that contains both the positional and rational parameters, the traditional geodesic algorithm is improved so that it becomes capable of planning robot trajectories that include both the position and the orientation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the improvement, trajectories are planned for two typical joint robots: one being a planar 3R and the other a spatial RRPP. It is verified that the improved algorithm can generate not only smooth motions for the joints but also smooth and accurate motions for the end-effector. The improved algorithm applies to multi-joint robots with no more than six degrees of freedom.},

Thanks to this direct connection, a new, global parametrization of the invariant manifolds is established. Unlike the classical parametrization using a pair of state-space variables, this parametrization remains valid whenever the invariant manifold undergoes folding, which extends the computation of NNMs to regimes of greater energy. The proposed ideas are illustrated using a two-degree-of-freedom system with cubic nonlinearity.},

This model treats textiles as surfaces that are inextensible, admitting only isometric motions. Inextensibility is derived in a continuous setting, prior to any discretization, which gives consistency with respect to remeshing and prevents the problem of locking even with coarse meshes. The simulations of robotic manipulation using the model are compared to the actual manipulation in the real world, finding that the difference between the simulated and the real position of each point in the garment is lower than 1cm in average even when a coarse mesh is used. Aerodynamic contributions to motion are incorporated to the model through the virtual uncoupling of the inertial and gravitational mass of the garment. This approach results in an accurate, when compared to the recorded dynamics of real textiles, description of cloth motion incorporating aerodynamic effects by using only two parameters.},

  abstract   = {The practice of robotics and computer vision both involve the application of computational algorithms to data. Over the fairly recent history of the fields of robotics and computer vision a very large body of algorithms has been developed. However this body of knowledge is something of a barrier for anybody entering the field, or even looking to see if they want to enter the field ��� What is the right algorithm for a particular problem?, and importantly, How can I try it out without spending days coding and debugging it from the original research papers?The author has maintained two open-source MATLAB Toolboxes for more than 10 years: one for robotics and one for vision. The key strength of the Toolboxes provide a set of tools that allow the user to work with real problems, not trivial examples. For the student the book makes the algorithms accessible, the Toolbox code can be read to gain understanding, and the examples illustrate how it can be used ���instant gratification in just a couple of lines of MATLAB code. The code can also be the starting point for new work, for researchers or students, by writing programs based on Toolbox functions, or modifying the Toolbox code itself. The purpose of this book is to expand on the tutorial material provided with the toolboxes, add many more examples, and to weave this into a narrative that covers robotics and computer vision separately and together. The author shows how complex problems can be decomposed and solved using just a few simple lines of code, and hopefully to inspire up and coming researchers. The topics covered are guided by the real problems observed over many years as a practitioner of both robotics and computer vision. It is written in a light but informative style, it is easy to read and absorb, and includes a lot of Matlab examples and figures. The book is a real walk through the fundamentals of robot kinematics, dynamics and joint level control, then camera models, image processing, feature extraction and epipolar geometry, and bring it all together in a visual servo system.

  abstract   = {We introduce the heat method for computing the geodesic distance to a specified subset (e.g., point or curve) of a given domain. The heat method is robust, efficient, and simple to implement since it is based on solving a pair of standard linear elliptic problems. The resulting systems can be prefactored once and subsequently solved in near-linear time. In practice, distance is updated an order of magnitude faster than with state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining a comparable level of accuracy. The method requires only standard differential operators and can hence be applied on a wide variety of domains (grids, triangle meshes, point clouds, etc.). We provide numerical evidence that the method converges to the exact distance in the limit of refinement; we also explore smoothed approximations of distance suitable for applications where greater regularity is required.},

  abstract      = {This paper proposes a supervised algorithm for online learning of input-output relations that is particularly suitable to simultaneously learn the forward and inverse kinematics of general manipulators - the multi-valued nature of the inverse kinematics of serial chains and forward kinematics of parallel manipulators makes it infeasible to apply state-of-the-art learning techniques to these problems, as they typically assume a single-valued function to be learned. The proposed algorithm is based on a generalized expectation maximization approach to fit an infinite mixture of linear experts to an online stream of data samples, together with an outlier probabilistic model that dynamically grows the number of linear experts allocated to the mixture, this way controlling the complexity of the resulting model. The result is an incremental, online and localized learning algorithm that performs nonlinear, multivariate regression on multivariate outputs by approximating the target function by a linear relation within each expert input domain, which can directly provide forward and inverse multi-valued estimates. The experiments presented in this paper show that it can achieve, for single-valued functions, a performance directly comparable to state-of-the-art online function approximation algorithms, while additionally providing inverse predictions and the capability to learn multi-valued functions in a natural manner. To our knowledge this is a distinctive property of the algorithm presented in this paper. © 2012 IEEE.},

  abstract   = {Probability and Statistics are studied by most science students, usually as a second- or third-year course. Many current texts in the area are just cookbooks and, as a result, students do not know why they perform the methods they are taught, or why the methods work. The strength of this book is that it readdresses these shortcomings; by using examples, often from real-life and using real data, the authors can show how the fundamentals of probabilistic and statistical theories arise intuitively. It provides a tried and tested, self-contained course, that can also be used for self-study.  A Modern Introduction to Probability and Statistics has numerous quick exercises to give direct feedback to the students. In addition the book contains over 350 exercises, half of which have answers, of which half have full solutions. A website at www.springeronline.com/1-85233-896-2 gives access to the data files used in the text, and, for instructors, the remaining solutions. The only pre-requisite for the book is a first course in calculus; the text covers standard statistics and probability material, and develops beyond traditional parametric models to the Poisson process, and on to useful modern methods such as the bootstrap.  This will be a key text for undergraduates in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology and Business Studies who are studying a mathematical statistics course, and also for more intensive engineering statistics courses for undergraduates in all engineering subjects.},

This in turn is an important feature which can be exploited in the execution of many tasks, as for example locomotion. Yet, an established theory and general techniques allowing to excite and sustain these nonlinear oscillations are still lacking. A possible solution to this problem comes from nonlinear modal theory, which defines curved extensions of linear Eigenspaces called Eigenmanifolds. Stabilizing these surfaces is equivalent to exciting regular hyper-efficient oscillations in the robotic system. This paper proposes a first experimental validation of the Eigenmanifold stabilization technique. It also proposes a simple yet effective means of injecting energy into the system, so to sustain the oscillations in presence of damping. We consider as experimental setups a single robotic leg, and a full soft quadruped. Preliminary locomotion results are provided with both systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract Parameterization of discrete surfaces is a fundamental and widely-used operation in graphics, required, for instance, for texture mapping or remeshing. As 3D data becomes more and more detailed, there is an increased need for fast and robust techniques to automatically compute least-distorted parameterizations of large meshes. In this paper, we present new theoretical and practical results on the parameterization of triangulated surface patches. Given a few desirable properties such as rotation and translation invariance, we show that the only admissible parameterizations form a two-dimensional set and each parameterization in this set can be computed using a simple, sparse, linear system. Since these parameterizations minimize the distortion of different intrinsic measures of the original mesh, we call them Intrinsic Parameterizations. In addition to this partial theoretical analysis, we propose robust, efficient and tunable tools to obtain least-distorted parameterizations automatically. In particular, we give details on a novel, fast technique to provide an optimal mapping without fixing the boundary positions, thus providing a unique Natural Intrinsic Parameterization. Other techniques based on this parameterization family, designed to ease the rapid design of parameterizations, are also proposed.},

The overall outcome of is a novel treatment of a continuum in robotics research. At first a description of the overall system as a tendon-driven multi-body system modeled by a nonlinear rigid-body dynamics is proposed. In combination with the introduced real-time pose and velocity estimation, nonlinear model-based control in real-time is possible. Furthermore, the structural properties of the model allow employing modern control methods for underactuated mechanical systems which are adapted to provide set point control for the upper platform.
The developed methods in modeling, state estimation and control presented in this work are experimentally validated on a humanoid robot.
Due to their promising results, this thesis lays the foundation for the use of tendon-driven continuum mechanisms as generic joint modules
for modular robotic systems which may mark the beginning of a new generation of light-weight robots.},

Dynamic consistency is preserved, and strict compliance with the order of priority is ensured at all times due to a power-conserving cancellation of coupling terms by active control. No external force measurements have to be performed. We show asymptotic stability of the generic closed-loop system with an arbitrary number of hierarchy levels.

  abstract = {One step on the way to approach human performance in robotics is to provide joint torque sensing and control for better interaction capabilities with the environment, and a large number of actuated degrees of freedom (DOFs) for improved versatility. However, the increasing complexity also raises the question of how to resolve the kinematic redundancy which is a direct consequence of the large number of DOFs. Here we give an overview of the most practical and frequently used torque control solutions based on null space projections. Two fundamental structures of task hierarchies are reviewed and compared, namely the successive and the augmented method. Then the projector itself is investigated in terms of its consistency. We analyze static, dynamic, and the new concept of stiffness consistency. In the latter case, stiffness information is used in the pseudoinversion instead of the inertia matrix. In terms of dynamic consistency, we generalize the weighting matrix from the classical operational space approach and show that an infinite number of weighting matrices exist to obtain dynamic consistency. In this context we also analyze another dynamically consistent null space projector with slightly different structure and properties. The redundancy resolutions are finally compared in several simulations and experiments. A thorough discussion of the theoretical and empirical results completes this survey.},

  year      = {2015},
  abstract  = {Humanoid service robots in domestic environments have to interact with humans and their surroundings in a safe and reliable way. One way to manage that is to equip the robotic systems with force-torque sensors to realize a physically compliant whole-body behavior via impedance control. To provide mobility, such robots often have wheeled platforms. The main advantage is that no balancing effort has to be made compared to legged humanoids. However, the nonholonomy of most wheeled systems prohibits the direct implementation of impedance control due to kinematic rolling constraints that must be taken into account in modeling and control. In this paper we design a whole-body impedance controller for such a robot, which employs an admittance interface to the kinematically controlled mobile platform. The upper body impedance control law, the platform admittance interface, and the compensation of dynamic couplings between both subsystems yield a passive closed loop. The convergence of the state to an invariant set is shown. To prove asymptotic stability in the case of redundancy, priority-based approaches can be employed. In principle, the presented approach is the extension of the well-known and established impedance controller to mobile robots. Experimental validations are performed on the humanoid robot Rollin{'} Justin. The method is suitable for compliant manipulation tasks with low-dimensional planning in the task space.},

  abstract  = {Introducing mobile humanoid robots into human environments requires the systems to physically interact and execute multiple concurrent tasks. The monograph at hand presents a whole-body torque controller for dexterous and safe robotic manipulation. This control approach enables a mobile humanoid robot to simultaneously meet several control objectives with different pre-defined levels of priority, while providing the skills for compliant physical contacts with humans and the environment.
After a general introduction into the topic of whole-body control, several essential reactive tasks are developed to extend the repertoire of robotic control objectives. Additionally, the classical Cartesian impedance is extended to the case of mobile robots. All of these tasks are then combined and integrated into an overall, priority-based control law. Besides the experimental validation of the approach, the formal proof of asymptotic stability for this hierarchical controller is presented. By interconnecting the whole-body controller with an artificial intelligence, the immense potential of the integrated approach for complex real-world applications is shown. Several typical household chores, such as autonomously wiping a window or sweeping the floor with a broom, are successfully performed on the mobile humanoid robot Rollin Justin of the German Aerospace Center (DLR).

The results suggest the presented controller for a large variety of fields of application such as service robotics, human-robot cooperation in industry, telepresence in medical applications, space robotics scenarios, and the operation of mobile robots in dangerous and hazardous environments.},

  abstract = {In trajectory tracking and interaction control of robots, two fundamentally different concepts define the boundaries within which most nonlinear model-based approaches can be located. On the one hand controllers such as the PD+ preserve the natural inertia and avoid feedback of external forces and torques. On the other hand controllers based on feedback linearization, as used in most inverse dynamics approaches, enforce linear closed-loop dynamics by means of external force/torque feedback. Here, these two basic concepts of keeping and shaping of the natural inertia are investigated and compared including aspects such as interaction behavior, tracking performance, tuning parameters, influence of modeling errors, and effective feedback gains. Exemplary case studies on a standard torque-controlled robot are performed. The understanding of these features and differences is of major importance for the proper selection and deployment of interaction and tracking controllers in practice.},

  abstract     = {Robokcs research has made extensive use of techniques based on me Moore-Penrose inverse, or generalized inverse, of matri als. Recently it has been pointed out how noninvariant results may, in general, be obtained by applying these techniques to other areas of robotics, namely hybrid control and inverse ve locity kinematics. Unfortunately, the problems are not restricted to just these particular areas in robotics but are connected with misleading definitions of the metric properties of the six- dimensional wrench and twist vector spaces used in robotics. The current definitions lead to inconsistent results (i.e., results that are not invariant with respect to changes in the reference frame andlor changes in the dimensional units used to express the problem. As a matter of fact, given a linear systemu = Ax,where the matrix A may be singular, the Moore-Penrose theory of generalized inverses may be properly and directly applied only when the vector space U of vectoruand the vector space X of vector xare inner product spaces. Arbitrary assignment of Euclidean inner products to the space U and X when the vectorsu andxhave elements with different physical units can lead to inconsistent and noninvariant results. In this article the problem of inconsistent, noninvariant solutionsXs tou = Axin robotics is briefly reviewed and a general theory for com puting consistent, gauge-invariant solutions to nonhomogeneous systems of the formu = Axis developed. In addition, the dual relationship between rigid-body kinematics and statics is de fined formally as a particular, linear algebraic system whose solution system is also a dual system. Examples illustrate the theory.},

The controller distributes the fast motion to the small fast manipulator and the slow gross motion to the positioning part. A position reference is generated on-line to the positioning part to avoid singularities and the loss of degrees of freedom. The task-space position vector is augmented by the generalized coordinates of the positioning part. Feedback linearization and decoupling are then applied in the augmented task space to obtain a model consisting of decoupled double integrators. These decoupled double integrators are controlled by the use of linear quadratic optimal control. In the optimal control problem the performance index is chosen so that the task-space position reference is tracked with a high bandwidth while the reference to the positioning part is tracked with a low bandwidth. The controller has been applied to a simple planar redundant manipulator and an eight-link spray painting robot in simulation experiments. These simulations showed that a high bandwidth was possible with moderate actuator torques.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) are a key tool for investigating the behaviour of nonlinear dynamic systems. Previous work has shown that branches of NNMs can be isolated from other NNM responses, in a similar manner to isolated, or detached, resonance curves in the forced responses. Their isolated nature poses a significant challenge for the prediction and measurement of these NNM branches. This paper illustrates how isolated NNMs may exist in two-degree-of-freedom systems, with cubic nonlinearities, that exhibit a 1:3 resonance. This is first introduced using a general two-mass oscillator, before considering a two-mode reduced-order model of a continuous cross-beam structure that exhibits a coupling between its primary bending and torsional modes. In both cases, a combination of analytical and numerical techniques is used to show how the isolated NNM branch may evolve from a set of bifurcating NNM branches. A nonlinear force appropriation technique is used to experimentally measure the NNMs of the cross-beam structure. By comparing these measurements to the numerical studies, it is shown that some of these NNMs are on the isolated branch, representing the first experimental confirmation of isolated NNM branches.},

The central idea is to map a given surface to the curvature domain by evaluating its principle curvatures, apply filtering and editing operations to the curvature distribution, and reconstruct the resulting surface using an optimization approach. Our system allows the user to prescribe arbitrary principle curvature values anywhere on the surface. The optimization solves a nonlinear least-squares problem to find the surface that best matches the desired target curvatures while preserving important properties of the original shape. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this processing metaphor with several applications, including anisotropic smoothing, feature enhancement, and multi-scale curvature editing.},

  abstract = {While feature diagrams have become the de facto standard to graphically describe variabilitymodels in Soware Product Line Engineering (SPLE), none of the many textual notations havegained widespread adoption.  However, a common textual language would be benecial forbeer collaboration and exchange between tools. e main goal of this thesis is to propose alanguage for this purpose, along with fundamental tool support. e language should meetthe needs and preferences of the community, so it can aain acceptance and adoption, withoutbecoming yet another variability language. Its guiding principles are simplicity, familiarity, andexibility. ese enable the language to be easy to learn and to integrate into different tools,while still being expressive enough to represent existing and future models.We incorporate general design principles for Domain-Specic Languages (DSLs), discussusage scenarios collected by the community, analyze existing languages, and gather feedbackdirectly through questionnaires submied to the community. In the initial questionnaire, thecommunity was in disagreement on whether to use nesting or references to represent thehierarchy.  us,  we presented two proposals to be compared side by side.  Of those,  thecommunity clearly prefers the one using nesting, as determined by a second questionnaire. Wecall it the Universal Variability Language (UVL). e community awards good ratings to thislanguage, deems it suitable for teaching and learning, and estimates that it can represent mostof the existing models. Evaluations reconsidering the requirements show that it enables therelevant scenarios and can support the editing of large-scale real-world feature models, suchas the Linux kernel. We provide a small default library that can be used in Java, containinga parser and a printer for the language. We integrated it into the variability tool FeatureIDE,demonstrating its utility in quickly adding support for the proposed language.Overall, we can conclude thatUVLis well-suited for a base language level of a universaltextual variability language. Along with the acquired insights into the requirements for such alanguage, it can pose as the basis for theSPLEcommunity to commit to a common language.As exchange and collaboration would be simplied, higher-quality research could be conductedand beer tools developed, serving the whole community.},

However, there are still two open problems: (1) without knowing inverse kinematic expressions, these solutions have the difficulty of how to collect training sets, and (2) the gradient-based learning algorithms can cause a very slow training process, especially for a complex configuration, or a large set of training data. Unlike these traditional implementations, the proposed metho trains neural network in joint subspace which can be easily calculated with electromagnetism-like method. The kinematics equation and its inverse are one-to-one mapping within the subspace. Thus the constrained training sets can be easily collected by forward kinematics relations. For issue 2, this paper uses a novel learning algorithm called extreme learning machine (ELM) which randomly choose the input weights and analytically determines the output weights of the single hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs). In theory, this algorithm tends to provide the best generalization performance at extremely fast learning speed. The results show that the proposed approach has not only greatly reduced the computation time but also improved the precision. © 2006-2012 by CCC Publications.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an experimental study on human-robot comanipulation in the presence of kinematic redundancy. The objective of the work is to enhance the performance during human-robot physical interaction by combining Cartesian impedance modulation and redundancy resolution. Cartesian impedance control is employed to achieve a compliant behavior of the robot's end effector in response to forces exerted by the human operator. Different impedance modulation strategies, which take into account the human's behavior during the interaction, are selected with the support of a simulation study and then experimentally tested on a 7-degree-of-freedom KUKA LWR4. A comparative study to establish the most effective redundancy resolution strategy has been made by evaluating different solutions compatible with the considered task. The experiments have shown that the redundancy, when used to ensure a decoupled apparent inertia at the end effector, allows enlarging the stability region in the impedance parameters space and improving the performance. On the other hand, the variable impedance with a suitable modulation strategy for parameters' tuning outperforms the constant impedance, in the sense that it enhances the comfort perceived by humans during manual guidance and allows reaching a favorable compromise between accuracy and execution time.},

  abstract = {This paper develops the theory of geodesic regression and least-squares estimation on Riemannian manifolds. Geodesic regression is a method for finding the relationship between a real-valued independent variable and a manifold-valued dependent random variable, where this relationship is modeled as a geodesic curve on the manifold. Least-squares estimation is formulated intrinsically as a minimization of the sum-of-squared geodesic distances of the data to the estimated model. Geodesic regression is a direct generalization of linear regression to the manifold setting, and it provides a simple parameterization of the estimated relationship as an initial point and velocity, analogous to the intercept and slope. A nonparametric permutation test for determining the significance of the trend is also given. For the case of symmetric spaces, two main theoretical results are established. First, conditions for existence and uniqueness of the least-squares problem are provided. Second, a maximum likelihood criteria is developed for a suitable definition of Gaussian errors on the manifold. While the method can be generally applied to data on any manifold, specific examples are given for a set of synthetically generated rotation data and an application to analyzing shape changes in the corpus callosum due to age.},

By explicitly considering the energy and power in a robotic system, many control and design problems become easier or more insightful than in a purely signal-based view. We show the application of these energy considerations to robotics; starting from the fundamental aspects, but, most importantly, continuing to the practical application to robotic systems. Using the theory of Port-Hamiltonian Systems as a fundamental basis, we show examples concerning energy measurement, passivity and safety. Control by interconnection covers the shaping and directing of energy inside the controller algorithms, to achieve desired behaviour in a power-consistent manner. This idea of control over the energy ﬂows is extended to the physical domain. In their mathematical description and analysis, the boundary between controller and robot disappears and everything is an interconnected system, driven by energy exchange between its parts.},

  abstract  = {You're not alone. At any given moment, somewhere in the world someone struggles with the same software design problems you have. You know you don't want to reinvent the wheel (or worse, a flat tire), so you look to Design Patterns--the lessons learned by those who've faced the same problems. With Design Patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others, so that you can spend your time on...something else. Something more challenging. Something more complex. Something more fun. You want to learn about the patterns that matter--why to use them, when to use them, how to use them (and when NOT to use them). But you don't just want to see how patterns look in a book, you want to know how they look "in the wild". In their native environment. In other words, in real world applications. You also want to learn how patterns are used in the Java API, and how to exploit Java's built-in pattern support in your own code. You want to learn the real OO design principles and why everything your boss told you about inheritance might be wrong (and what to do instead). You want to learn how those principles will help the next time you're up a creek without a design pattern. Most importantly, you want to learn the "secret language" of Design Patterns so that you can hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions his stunningly clever use of Command, Facade, Proxy, and Factory in between sips of a martini. You'll easily counter with your deep understanding of why Singleton isn't as simple as it sounds, how the Factory is so often misunderstood, or on the real relationship between Decorator, Facade and Adapter. With Head First Design Patterns, you'll avoid the embarrassment of thinking Decorator is something from the "Trading Spaces" show. Best of all, in a way that won't put you to sleep! We think your time is too important (and too short) to spend it struggling with academic texts. If you've read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually rich format designed for the way your brain works. Using the latest research in neurobiology, cognitive science, and learning theory, Head First Design Patterns will load patterns into your brain in a way that sticks. In a way that lets you put them to work immediately. In a way that makes you better at solving software design problems, and better at speaking the language of patterns with others on your team.},

All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

  abstract = {We argue that there arefourbasic forms of the variational principles of mechanics: Hamilton's least action principle (HP), the generalized Maupertuis principle (MP), and their two reciprocal principles, RHP and RMP. This set is invariant under reciprocity and Legendre transformations. One of these forms (HP) is in the literature: only special cases of the other three are known. The generalized MP has a weaker constraint compared to the traditional formulation: only the mean energy Ē is kept fixed between virtual paths. This reformulation of MP alleviates several weaknesses of the old version. The reciprocal Maupertuis principle (RMP) is the classical limit of Schrödinger's variational principle of quantum mechanics, and this connection emphasizes the importance of the reciprocity transformation for variational principles. Two unconstrained formulations (UHP and UMP) of these four principles are also proposed, with completely specified Lagrange multipliers. Percival's variational principle for invariant tori and variational principles for scattering orbits are derived from the RMP. The RMP is very convenient for approximate variational solutions to problems in mechanics using Ritz type methods. Examples are provided.},

  abstract        = {A parallel manipulator is a closed kinematic structure with the necessary rigidity to provide a high payload to self-weight ratio suitable for many applications in manufacturing, flight simulation systems, and medical robotics. Because of its closed structure, the kinematic control of such a mechanism is difficult. The inverse kinematics problem for such manipulators has a mathematical solution but, the forward kinematics problem (FKP) is mathematically intractable. This paper presents a Stewart platform with asymmetric payload and proposes a neural-network-based strategy that solves the problem of FKP to a desire level of accuracy, and can apply the solution for any other desire trajectory. The Neural-network concepts with backpropagation learning is implemented. The inverse kinematic is used to obtain the required force for desire trajectory. Then, neural network is taken into account to take actuator forces as inputs and train the system in order to reach the desire path. It is concluded that, neural network results are acceptable and can be applied for any desire path. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

  abstract = {Microstructural characteristics play a significant role in the determination of effective properties of materials. Consequently, most numerical tools aimed at predicting such properties require, as a starting point, the availability of geometric representations of such microstructures. In this paper, we introduce a method for generating statistically representative synthetic microstructures for materials involving multiple phases. Our method is based on traditional seed placement and tessellation approaches, with three critical improvements: (i) allowing for controlled seed overlap to better represent microstructural statistics, (ii) multi-sphere representation of 3D ellipsoids to account for arbitrarily elongated grains, and (iii) novel application of the axis aligned bounding box tree structure for accelerated seed placement. Our method recreates a diverse set of microstructural features, including the presence of spherical and non-spherical grain geometries, amorphous phases, and voids. After the method is presented, we proceed with a rigorous numerical analysis demonstrating its ability to reproduce key statistical features of target microstructures. The algorithms presented are freely available and open source through the package MicroStructPy.},

  abstract = {The locomotion of articulated mechanical systems is often complex and unintuitive, even when considered with the aid of reduction principles from geometric mechanics. In this paper, we present two tools for gaining insights into the underlying principles of locomotion: connection vector fields and connection height functions . Connection vector fields illustrate the geometric structure of the relationship between internal shape changes and the system body velocities they produce. Connection height functions measure the curvature of their respective vector fields and capture the net displacement over any cyclic shape change, or gait , allowing for the intuitive selection of gaits to produce desired displacements. Height function approaches have been previously attempted, but such techniques have been severely limited by their basis in a rotating body frame, and have only been useful for calculating planar rotations and infinitesimal translations. We circumvent this limitation by introducing a notion of optimal coordinates defining a body frame that rotates very little in response to shape changes, while still meeting the requirements of the geometric mechanics theory on which the vector fields and height functions are based. In these optimal coordinates, the height functions provide close approximations of the net displacement resulting from a broad selection of possible gaits.},

Moreover, the proposed algorithm can achieve the desired accuracy using 1000 training samples at most, which is far less than those of other algorithms. Simulation results on a Stewart platform used in aircraft flight simulation system show that the proposed algorithm can achieve superior performance. © IMechE 2012.},

  abstract = {This work presents a new control approach to multi-contact balancing for torque-controlled humanoid robots. The controller includes a non-strict task hierarchy, which allows the robot to use a subset of its end effectors for balancing while the remaining ones can be used for interacting with the environment. The controller creates a passive and compliant behavior for regulating the center of mass (CoM) location, hip orientation and the poses of each end effector assigned to the interaction task. This is achieved by applying a suitable wrench (force and torque) at each one of the end effectors used for interaction. The contact wrenches at the balancing end effectors are chosen such that the sum of the balancing and interaction wrenches produce the desired wrench at the CoM. The algorithm requires the solution of an optimization problem, which distributes the CoM wrench to the end effectors taking into account constraints for unilaterality, friction and position of the center of pressure. Furthermore, the feedback controller is combined with a feedforward control in order to improve performance while tracking a predefined trajectory, leading to a control structure similar to a PD+ control. The controller is evaluated in several experiments with the humanoid robot TORO.},

  abstract = {Nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) are widely used as a tool for understanding the forced responses of nonlinear systems. However, the contemporary definition of an NNM also encompasses a large number of dynamic behaviours which are not observed when a system is forced and damped. As such, only a few NNMs are required to understand the forced dynamics. This paper firstly demonstrates the complexity that may arise from the NNMs of a simple nonlinear system—highlighting the need for a method for identifying the significance of NNMs. An analytical investigation is used, alongside energy arguments, to develop an understanding of the mechanisms that relate the NNMs to the forced responses. This provides insight into which NNMs are pertinent to understanding the forced dynamics, and which may be disregarded. The NNMs are compared with simulated forced responses to verify these findings.},

  abstract = {Time-delay embedding and dimensionality reduction are powerful techniques for discovering effective coordinate systems to represent the dynamics of physical systems. Recently, it has been shown that models identified by dynamic mode decomposition on time-delay coordinates provide linear representations of strongly nonlinear systems, in the so-called Hankel alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK) approach. Curiously, the resulting linear model has a matrix representation that is approximately antisymmetric and tridiagonal; for chaotic systems, there is an additional forcing term in the last component. In this paper, we establish a new theoretical connection between HAVOK and the Frenet–Serret frame from differential geometry, and also develop an improved algorithm to identify more stable and accurate models from less data. In particular, we show that the sub- and super-diagonal entries of the linear model correspond to the intrinsic curvatures in the Frenet–Serret frame. Based on this connection, we modify the algorithm to promote this antisymmetric structure, even in the noisy, low-data limit. We demonstrate this improved modelling procedure on data from several nonlinear synthetic and real-world examples.},

When the generalized inverse is formulated in terms of accelerations and incorporated into the dynamics, the effect of redundancy resolution on joint torque can be directly reflected. One method chooses the joint acceleration null-space vector to minimize joint torque in a least squares sense; when the least squares is weighted by allowable torque range, the joint torques tend to be kept within their limits. Contrasting methods employing only the pseudoinverse with and without weighting by the inertia matrix are presented. The results show an unexpected stability problem during long trajectories for the null-space methods and for the inertia-weighted pseudoinverse method, but more seldom for the unweighted pseudoinverse method. Evidently, a whiplash action develops over time that thrusts the endpoint off the intended path, and extremely high torques are required to overcome these natural movement dynamics.},

Evolution has shaped the breathtaking abilities of animals, leaving us the challenge of reconstructing their targets of control and mechanisms of dexterity. In this review we explore a corner of this fascinating world. We describe mathematical models for legged animal locomotion, focusing on rapidly running insects and highlighting past achievements and challenges that remain. Newtonian body--limb dynamics are most naturally formulated as piecewise-holonomic rigid body mechanical systems, whose constraints change as legs touch down or lift off. Central pattern generators and proprioceptive sensing require models of spiking neurons and simplified phase oscillator descriptions of ensembles of them. A full neuromechanical model of a running animal requires integration of these elements, along with proprioceptive feedback and models of goal-oriented sensing, planning, and learning. We outline relevant background material from biomechanics and neurobiology, explain key properties of the hybrid dynamical systems that underlie legged locomotion models, and provide numerous examples of such models, from the simplest, completely soluble "peg-leg walker" to complex neuromuscular subsystems that are yet to be assembled into models of behaving animals. This final integration in a tractable and illuminating model is an outstanding challenge.},

The design consists of a stainless-steel pole that acts as the pendulum, which is pivoted at one end and attached to a cart. Although in its inverted configuration the pendulum is unstable without suitable control, if the cart travels backwards and forwards appropriately it is possible to balance the pole and keep it upright. The pendulum is intended for use as a research and teaching tool in the fields of control engineering and human sensori-motor control. We demonstrate operation of the design by implementing an observer-based state feedback controller, with augmented positional state of the cart and integral action, that can balance the pole in its unstable configuration and also maintains the cart at its starting position. When the controller is running, the pendulum can resist small disturbances to the pole, and it is possible to balance objects on its endpoint.},

For an accurate path-guidance it is important to know or estimate the direction of the tool tip's motion. Therefor it is necessary to predict the future direction. In this work, the predicted direction is based on clustering applied to typical trajectory sets, combined with building first and second order Markov models which represent cluster transitions. A coarse prediction is obtained by cluster transitions. For improvement, this is refined by projecting the cluster points distribution on a (unit) sphere surrounding the current tool tip position. For the latter step, a discrete procedure is proposed that takes into account the most likely consecutive cluster(s). The resulting predicted direction can be used to guide the robot's movement, especially by controlling the joint angles of a redundant robot in order to avoid joint limits. The main focus of this work is on the actual prediction of direction which is evaluated using a synthetic test scenario.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we enhance an inversion-based control approach towards the stabilization of a periodic orbit of a multi-link triple pendulum on a cart. To this end, a nominal trajectory is obtained by formulating the considered transition problem as a two-point boundary value problem (BVP) in input–output representation. For solvability of the resulting BVP, a setup function is introduced such that additional parameters are provided in the differential equation of the internal dynamics. Based on the linearized dynamics about the nominal trajectory, a linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) controller is implemented to compensate for measurement noise, model uncertainties, and external disturbances. This way we achieve to force a triple pendulum to move along a non-trivial periodic orbit and render it attractive. The high performance and accuracy of our approach is illustrated on an experimental setup.},

Therefore, error compensation plays a pivotal role in many industrial robotic applications with high accuracy requirement. In this paper, we present a novel computational method that utilizes a hybrid model that consists of Local Product-Of-Exponential (POE) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to compensate the positioning errors of the industrial robotic manipulator for high accuracy industrial robotic applications. Specifically in the proposed method, the Local POE calibration method is first applied to calibrate the robot forward kinematic model to reduce the geometric error. Then the GPR is applied to learn the inverse kinematic model to further compensate the residual error in task space. We also demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our proposed method by showing the reduction of norm pose error by up to 37.2%, compared to the existing methods with multiple datasets. © 2018 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Despite the advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence, there are many tooling tasks with cognitive aspects that are rather challenging for robots to handle in full autonomy, thus still requiring a certain degree of interaction with a human operator. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for both planning and execution of robot-surface contact tasks whereby interaction with a human operator can be accommodated to a variable degree. The starting point is the geometry of surface, which we assume known and available in a discretized format, e.g. through scanning technologies. To allow for realtime computation, rather than interacting with thousands of vertices, the robot only interacts with a single proxy, i.e. a massless virtual object constrained to ‘live on’ the surface and subject to first order viscous dynamics. The proxy and an impedance-controlled robot are then connected through tuneable and possibly viscoelastic coupling, i.e. (virtual) springs and dampers. On the one hand, the proxy slides along discrete geodesics of the surface in response to both viscoelastic coupling with the robot and to a possible external force (a virtual force which can be used to induce autonomous behaviours). On the other hand, the robot is free to move in 3D in reaction to the same viscoelastic coupling as well as to a possible external force, which includes an actual force exerted by a human operator. The proposed approach is multi-objective in the sense that different operational (autonomous/collaborative) and interactive (for contact/non-contact tasks) modalities can be realized by simply modulating the viscoelastic coupling as well as virtual and physical external forces. We believe that our proposed framework might lead to a more intuitive interfacing to robot programming, as opposed to standard coding. To this end, we also present numerical and experimental studies demonstrating path planning as well as autonomous and collaborative interaction for contact tasks with a free-form surface.},

Thus, they are well suited for applications such as aircraft component machining and automotive assembly, where high accuracy and large workspace movements are required. However, their forward kinematics can be highly coupled and be nonlinear. To reduce the time required to define the forward kinematics of a robot with parallel-serial structure, this paper introduces the use of neural networks. Two radial basis function networks are trained to learn the parallel and serial kinematics separately, and then integrated into a complete model. The error of this network model is analyzed and identified by a particle swarm optimization algorithm. Simulation and experiment results are obtained from the hybrid robot, Exechon, which shows that the developed kinematic model is able to produce accurate position and orientation estimates of the end-effector. The computation time of the neural network model is greatly reduced when compared to the time achieved by the numerical model. © 2011 Cambridge University Press.},

This is in particular critical for untethered legged robot locomotion. To elucidate the current stage of energy efficiency in legged robotic systems, this paper provides an overview on recent advancements in development of such platforms. The covered different perspectives include actuation, leg structure, control and locomotion principles. We review various robotic actuators exploiting compliance in series and in parallel with the drive-train to permit energy recycling during locomotion. We discuss the importance of limb segmentation under efficiency aspects and with respect to design, dynamics analysis and control of legged robots. This paper also reviews a number of control approaches allowing for energy efficient locomotion of robots by exploiting the natural dynamics of the system, and by utilizing optimal control approaches targeting locomotion expenditure. To this end, a set of locomotion principles elaborating on models for energetics, dynamics, and of the systems is studied.},

  abstract   = {Poisson surface reconstruction creates watertight surfaces from oriented point sets. In this work we extend the technique to explicitly incorporate the points as interpolation constraints. The extension can be interpreted as a generalization of the underlying mathematical framework to a screened Poisson equation. In contrast to other image and geometry processing techniques, the screening term is defined over a sparse set of points rather than over the full domain. We show that these sparse constraints can nonetheless be integrated efficiently. Because the modified linear system retains the same finite-element discretization, the sparsity structure is unchanged, and the system can still be solved using a multigrid approach. Moreover we present several algorithmic improvements that together reduce the time complexity of the solver to linear in the number of points, thereby enabling faster, higher-quality surface reconstructions.},

Another objective of the present paper is to describe, in simple terms, and to illustrate the fundamental properties of NNMs. This is achieved to convince the structural dynamicist not necessarily acquainted with them that they are a useful framework for the analysis of nonlinear vibrating structures.},

In this approach, collision avoidance, traditionally considered a high level planning problem, can be effectively distributed between different levels of control, allowing real-time robot operations in a complex environment. We have applied this obstacle avoidance scheme to robot arm using a new approach to the general problem of real-time manipulator control. We reformulated the manipulator control problem as direct control of manipulator motion in operational space-the space in which the task is originally described-rather than as control of the task's corresponding joint space motion obtained only after geometric and kinematic transformation. This method has been implemented in the COSMOS system for a PUMA 560 robot. Using visual sensing, real-time collision avoidance demonstrations on moving obstacles have been performed.},

  abstract = {Consideration of dynamics is critical in the analysis, design, and control of robot systems. This article presents an extensive study of the dynamic properties of several important classes of robotic structures and proposes a number of general dynamic strategies for their coordination and control. This work is a synthesis of both previous and new results developed within the task-oriented operational space formulation. Here we in troduce a unifying framework for the analysis and control of robotic systems, beginning with an analysis of inertial prop erties based on two models that independently describe the mass and inertial characteristics associated with linear and angular motions. To visualize these properties, we propose a new geometric representation, termed the belted ellipsoid, that displays the magnitudes of the mass/inertial properties directly rather than their square roots. Our study of serial macro/mini structures is based on two models of redundant mechanisms. The first is a description of the task-level dy namics that results from projecting the system dynamics into operational space. The second is a unique dynamically con sistent relationship between end-effector forces and joint torques. It divides control torques at the joint level into two dynamically decoupled vectors: torques that correspond to forces at the end effector, and torques that affect only internal motions. The analysis of inertial properties of macro-/mini- manipulator systems reveals another important characteristic: that of reduced effective inertia. We show that the effective mass/inertia of a macro-/mini-manipulator is bounded above by the mass/inertia of the mini-manipulator alone. Because mini structures have a limited range of motion, we also pro pose a dextrous dynamic coordination strategy to allow full use of the high mechanical bandwidth of the mini-structures in extended-motion operations. Finally, a study of the dy namics of parallel, multiarm structures reveals an important additive property. The effective mass and inertia of a multi arm system at some operational point are shown to be given by the sum of the effective masses and inertias associated with the object and each arm. Using this property, the mul tiarm system can be treated as a single augmented object and controlled by the total operational forces applied by the arms. Both the augmented object construct and the dynam ically consistent force/torque relationship are extended for the analysis and control of multiarm systems involving redun dancy.},

The case of nonlinear oscillations described by the exact equations of motion is examined. A global qualitative insight is provided via energy diagrams and Poincaré maps. Then, the case of linear oscillations, their normal modes and associated frequencies is analysed. Further, quantitative insights via two approaches (Lindstedt-Poincaré method and harmonic balancing) are also achieved to determine analytically the influence of initial amplitudes on the existence and frequency of nonlinear normal modes. These results are compared with the one corresponding to the linear normal modes as well as with the corresponding numerical solutions of the exact equations of motion.},

  title    = {Multi-Object Tracking in Aerial and Satellite Imagery},
  year     = {2020},
  abstract = {Multi-pedestrian and -vehicle tracking in aerial imagery has several critical applications, including event monitoring, disaster management, predictive traffic, and transport efficiency. While some research works already studied vehicle tracking in remote sensing scenarios, pedestrian tracking has not found the necessary attraction caused by the insufficient level of detail in aerial imagery. Recently, the development of better camera systems and the possibility to capture aerial imagery at low-cost paved the way for establishing novel tracking approaches based on remote sensing. However, current state-of-the-art algorithms, including deep learning based methods, perform especially poorly with pedestrians in aerial imagery, incapable of handling severe challenges such as the large number and the tiny size of the pedestrians (e.g., 4 {$\times$} 4 pixels) with their similar appearances as well as different scales, atmospheric conditions, low frame rates, and moving camera. In contrast to vehicles moving along predetermined paths, such as highways or streets, pedestrians show more difficult motion characteristics posing additional demands on the tracker. Within the scope of this master thesis, we propose AerialMPTNet, a novel regression-based deep neural network able to tackle the challenges of pedestrian and vehicle tracking in geo-referenced aerial imagery. AerialMPTNet fuses appearance features by a Siamese Neural Network with movement prediction of a Long Short-Term Memory and adjacent graphical features of Graph Convolutional Neural Network. In contrast to previous works, we encode the motion model and the adjacent neighbor modeling in an end-to-end fashion as part of the neural network. Consequently, our network can learn motion characteristics directly from the data and additionally learns to weight the influence of surrounding objects. Furthermore, to
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply Squeeze-and-Excitation layers and Online Hard Example Mining to a regression-based deep tracker. We evaluate AerialMPNet intensively on two aerial pedestrian datasets, AerialMPT and
KIT AIS pedestrian. Both datasets consist of multiple image sequences captured at two frames per second on different flying altitudes, showing different crowd densities and different terrain (e.g., open-air concerts, Munich city areas, BAUMA trade fair). Results indicate that AerialMPTNet outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms such as Tracktor++, SMSOT-CNN or DCFNet on pedestrian tracking in aerial imagery significantly. Compared to the SMSOT-CNN baseline, multiple-object tracker accuracy (MOTA) improves by 18.8 points to -16.2 and by 13.8 points to -23.4 on KIT AIS pedestrian and AerialMPT, respectively. Additionally, we evaluate our approach on the KIT AIS vehicle dataset. AerialMPTNet achieves a competitive MOTA score of 42.0. Since we fitted our method gradually for pedestrian tracking, other trackers achieve better scores here.},

The stability proof is based on multiple Lyapunov functions and a new interpretation of contraction analysis. By showing that the dissipated energy on the cycle increases with increasing velocity, while the injected energy is constant, the emergence of an attractive limit cycle is shown. The approach applies for general, nonlinear, and compliantly actuated second-order systems, with positive definite plant parameters and non-aperiodic solutions. An analysis of the controller parameters reveals, that for the majority of parameters, global attractiveness of the limit cycle can be guaranteed.},

We follow with a survey of the state of the art on the theory of reversible dynamical systems, including results on symmetric periodic orbits, local bifurcation theory, homoclinic orbits, and renormalization and scaling. Some areas of physics and mathematics in which reversible dynamical systems arise are discussed.

  abstract        = {Task-space control is well studied in modeling speech production [1, 2, 3, 4]. Implementing control of this kind requires an accurate kinematic forward model. Despite debate about how to define the tasks for speech (i.e., acoustical vs. articulatory), a faithful forward model will be complex and infeasible to express analytically. Thus, it is necessary to learn the forward model from data. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have previously been suggested for this [3, 4, 6]. We argue for the use of locally-linear methods, such as Locally-Weighted Regression (LWR). While ANNs are capable of learning complex forward maps, LWR is more appropriate. Common formulations of control assume locally-linearity, whereas ANNs fit a nonlinear model to the entire map. Likewise, training LWR is simple compared to the complex optimization for ANNs. We provide an empirical comparison of these methods for learning a vocal tract forward model, discussing theoretical and practical aspects of each. © 2010 ISCA.},

  abstract  = {If you program in C++ you've been neglected. Test-driven development (TDD) is a modern software development practice that can dramatically reduce the number of defects in systems, produce more maintainable code, and give you the confidence to change your software to meet changing needs. But C++ programmers have been ignored by those promoting TDD--until now. In this book, Jeff Langr gives you hands-on lessons in the challenges and rewards of doing TDD in C++.Modern C++ Programming With Test-Driven Development, the only comprehensive treatment on TDD in C++ provides you with everything you need to know about TDD, and the challenges and benefits of implementing it in your C++ systems. Its many detailed code examples take you step-by-step from TDD basics to advanced concepts. As a veteran C++ programmer, you're already writing high-quality code, and you work hard to maintain code quality. It doesn't have to be that hard. In this book, you'll learn: how to use TDD to improve legacy C++ systems how to identify and deal with troublesome system dependencies how to do dependency injection, which is particularly tricky in C++ how to use testing tools for C++ that aid TDD new C++11 features that facilitate TDD As you grow in TDD mastery, you'll discover how to keep a massive C++ system from becoming a design mess over time, as well as particular C++ trouble spots to avoid. You'll find out how to prevent your tests from being a maintenance burden and how to think in TDD without giving up your hard-won C++ skills. Finally, you'll see how to grow and sustain TDD in your team. Whether you're a complete unit-testing novice or an experienced tester, this book will lead you to mastery of test-driven development in C++.What You Need A C++ compiler running under Windows or Linux, preferably one that supports C++11. Examples presented in the book were built under gcc 4.7.2. Google Mock 1.6 (downloadable for free; it contains Google Test as well) or an alternate C++ unit testing tool. Most examples in the book are written for Google Mock, but it isn't difficult to translate them to your tool of choice. A good programmer's editor or IDE. cmake, preferably. Of course, you can use your own preferred make too. CMakeLists.txt files are provided for each project. Examples provided were built using cmake version 2.8.9. Various freely-available third-party libraries are used as the basis for examples in the book. These include: - cURL - JsonCpp - Boost (filesystem, date_time/gregorian, algorithm, assign) Several examples use the boost headers/libraries. Only one example uses cURL and JsonCpp.},

  abstract    = {Universell einsetzbare Serviceroboter m{\"u}ssen in der Lage sein vielf{\"a}ltige Aufgaben zu erledigen. M{\"o}gliche Anwendungen reichen von der Unterst{\"u}tzung von Pflegepersonal in der Altenpflegebis hin zur Wartung von Solarmodulen auf dem Mars. Verglichen mit Industrierobotern, die haupts{\"a}chlich in strukturierter, {\"u}berwachbarer Umgebung agieren, unterliegt die Umgebung von Servicerobotern kontinuierlichen {\"A}nderungen. Diese {\"A}nderungen k{\"o}nnen beispielsweise durch Menschen geschehen, die mit der Umgebung interagieren. Aufgrund der Komplexit{\"a}t dieser Umgebungen, in denen Serviceroboter agieren m{\"u}ssen, werden sie unter dem Paradigma der supervised Autonomy betrieben. Unter supervised Autonomy versteht man, dass menschliche Operatoren in der Lage sind abstrakte Aufgaben zu definieren und die Roboter daraufhin selbstst{\"a}ndig Aktionsketten planen, mit denen das Ziel erreicht werden kann. Um solche komplexen Handlungsabl{\"a}ufe zu planen wird neben der geometrischen Planung auch die symbolische Planung eingesetzt. Auf der Grundlage von Aktionen, die sowohl eine symbolische als auch eine geometrische Beschreibung enthalten, k{\"o}nnen Roboter absch{\"a}tzen, welche symbolischen Voraussetzungen f{\"u}r die Aktionen gegeben sein m{\"u}ssen und wie die Aktionen die symbolische Welt ver{\"a}ndern. Dieses Wissen wird verwendet, um Aktionsketten zu planen, die das gew{\"u}nschte Ziel erf{\"u}llen. Aufgrund der sich st{\"a}ndig {\"a}ndernden Umgebungen kann sich die Welt w{\"a}hrend der Ausf{\"u}hrung von Aktionssequenzen ver{\"a}ndern. Allerdings sind Roboter noch nicht in der Lage diese Ver{\"a}nderungen der Welt w{\"a}hrend der Ausf{\"u}hrung von Aktionssequenzen zu erkennen. Momentan ist es so, dass Serviceroboter eine fehlerfreie Ausf{\"u}hrung annehmen, nachdem sie eine Aktionskette erfolgreich geplant haben. Dabei ist es egal, ob bei der Ausf{\"u}hrung etwas schief geht. Um dieses Problem zu beheben, m{\"u}ssen Roboter in der Lage sein, Abweichungen vom erforderlichen symbolischen Zustand zu erkennen. Um diese Abweichungen in der realen Welt erkennen zu k{\"o}nnen m{\"u}ssen Roboter eine Repr{\"a}sentation von Symbolen in Sensorinformationen kennen. Diese Arbeit besch{\"a}ftigt sich mit den oben genannten Herausforderungen. Um Symbole mit Sensorinformationen zu verkn{\"u}pfen, untersuchen wir erst die Bedeutung des Begriffs Symbol und betrachten die Erdung der Symbole in Sensorinformationen von verschiedenen Perspektiven. Wir verwenden maschinelles Lernen f{\"u}r die Verifizierung verschiedener Symbole mittels Sensorinformationen. Insbesondere betrachten wir Algorithmen zur Ausrei{\ss}ererkennung, da diese gute Eigenschaften haben um mit wenigen Trainingsdaten zurechtzukommen. Dieser Ansatz l{\"a}sst sich als Top-Down-Verifikation von Symbolen beschreiben. Jedoch birgt dieser Ansatz Nachteile auf Grund der Interpretierbarkeit von Symbolen. Um diese Nachteile zu kompensieren, untersuchen wir wie symbolische Emergenz eingesetzt werden kann. Hierf{\"u}r zeigen wir, wie mit Hilfe von multimodaler Latent Dirichlet Allocation latente Symbole un{\"u}berwacht gelernt werden k{\"o}nnen. Auf Basis des Top-Down Verifikation Ansatzes implementieren wir ein Verfahren zur {\"U}berwachung von Aktionssequenzen. Dieses Verfahren integrieren wir in die Roboterplattform Rollin Justin, einem am Deutschen Zentrum f{\"u}r Luft- und Raumfahrt entwickelten humanoiden Roboter. In diesem Prozess werden die trainierten Modelle des maschinellen Lernens mittels kleiner Python Codeschnipsel integriert, die Code f{\"u}r die Vorverarbeitung von Sensordaten und die Verifikation von Symbolen anhand der trainierten Modelle enthalten. Dieser Verifikationsprozess ebnet Robotern den Weg auf {\"A}nderungen in der Umgebung w{\"a}hrend der Ausf{\"u}hrung von Aktionssequenzen zu reagieren.},

  abstract    = {This thesis examines the detection of geometric changes in 3D data based on models derived from the point clouds. The process chain consists of the registration of point clouds, the derivation of a model and the detection of changes in these models.
For the registration AprilTags are used, which, in combination with the trajectories of the respective measuring runs, allow the estimation of a transformation between two local coordinate systems without a preceding assessment of the tag position.
The point cloud is sampled down to a uniform distribution for faster processing and the normals and curvatures are calculated for the remaining points. A region growing process uses this additional information to divide the point clouds into planar and nonplanar areas. The former are modeled as planes through simplification and meshing using a modified quadtree structure. The non-planar points are clustered by supervoxels and the extracted clusters are approximated by Axis Aligned Bounding Boxes. Both planar and non-planar modeling is performed for all datasets which are to be compared. The bounding boxes are used for the detection of changes. The box model of a dataset can easily be examined for intersections with a second dataset, due to the axis alignment. The intersections allow the detection of changed areas in the derived models.
The methods proposed are suitable for both indoor and outdoor applications, provided that the changed objects are well separated and the compared datasets cover overlapping areas. The accuracy depends on the chosen size of the bounding boxes as well as the size of the changed objects. The evaluation has also shown that the proposed method can be integrated into a realtime-capable system.},

  month       = oct,
  abstract    = {Physically compliant contact is a major element for many tasks in everyday environments. A universal service robot that is utilized to collect leaves in a park, polish a workpiece, or clean solar panels requires the cognition and manipulation capabilities to facilitate such compliant interaction. Evolution equipped humans with advanced mental abilities to envision physical contact situations and their resulting outcome, dexterous motor skills to perform the actions accordingly, as well as a sense of quality to rate the outcome of the task. In order to achieve human-like performance, a robot must provide the necessary methods to represent, plan, execute, and interpret compliant manipulation tasks. This dissertation covers those four steps of reasoning in the concept of intelligent physical compliance. The contributions advance the capabilities of service robots by combining artificial intelligence reasoning methods and control strategies for compliant manipulation. A classification of manipulation tasks is conducted to identify the central research questions of the addressed topic. Novel representations are derived to describe the properties of physical interaction. Special attention is given to wiping tasks which are predominant in everyday environments. It is investigated how symbolic task descriptions can be translated into meaningful robot commands. A particle distribution model is used to plan goal-oriented wiping actions and predict the quality according to the anticipated result. The planned tool motions are converted into the joint space of the humanoid robot Rollin' Justin to perform the tasks in the real world. In order to execute the motions in a physically compliant fashion, a hierarchical whole-body impedance controller is integrated into the framework. The controller is automatically parameterized with respect to the requirements of the particular task. Haptic feedback is utilized to infer contact and interpret the performance semantically. Finally, the robot is able to compensate for possible disturbances as it plans additional recovery motions while effectively closing the cognitive control loop. Among others, the developed concept is applied in an actual space robotics mission, in which an astronaut aboard the International Space Station (ISS) commands Rollin' Justin to maintain a Martian solar panel farm in a mock-up environment. This application demonstrates the far-reaching impact of the proposed approach and the associated opportunities that emerge with the availability of cognition-enabled service robots.},

A passivity analysis is done for this friction compensation, allowing a Lyapunov based convergence analysis in the context of the nonlinear robot dynamics.

Making use of the property that it is easy to obtain the inverse kinematics of 6-DOF parallel robot, the forward kinematics of the 6-DOF parallel robot is transformed by using inverse kinematics results through training and learning. The nonlinear mapping from the joint variable space to the operation variable space for the platform is accomplished solving the location and posture. The BP neural network is used to solve the forward kinematics, and the particle swarm optimization is applied to train the neural network. Simulation results show that this approach can be used for the online control of parallel robot with faster computing speed and more accurate solution. © 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract        = {In this study, we propose an alternative technique for solving the forward kinematic problem of parallel manipulator which is designed based on generalized Stewart platform. The focus of this work is to predict a pose vector of a moving plate from a given set of six leg lengths. Since the data of parallel kinematics are usually available in the form of nonlinear dynamic system, several methods of system identification have been proposed in order to construct the forward kinematic model and approximate the pose vectors. Although these methods based on a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network provide acceptable results, MLP training suffers from convergence to local optima. Thus, we propose to use an alternative supervised learning algorithm called vector-quantized temporal associative memory (VQTAM) instead of MLP-based methods. VQTAM relying on self-organizing map architecture is used to build the mapping from the input space to the output space such that the training/testing datasets are generated from inverse kinematic model. The solutions from standard VQTAM are improved by an autoregressive (AR) model and locally linear embedding (LLE). The experimental results indicate that VQTAM with AR/LLE gives the outputs with nearly 100% prediction accuracy in the case of smooth data, while VQTAM + LLE provides the most accurate prediction on noisy data. Therefore, VQTAM + LLE is a very robust estimation method and can practically be used for solving the forward kinematic problem. © 2017, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.},

  abstract      = {Redundant manipulator has good prospects for diverse and complex space operation tasks. However, teaching by demonstration of robot skills in the presence of redundancy is difficult and inefficient for non-expert users, especially with large and highly redundant manipulator, especially in complex confined scenarios. To master this task, two remote user interface systems are proposed and compared, which both comprise an input interface using mouse and keyboard, a visualization, an inverse kinematic solver and a machine learning component. The learner is used to generalize from a limited number of examples to a preferred redundancy resolution for a typical 7-DoF robot arm. The methods differ in the information that users can provide either through a novel approach to adjust Cartesian positions of certain key points on the robot's links and solve the inverse kinematics problem analytically, referred to as Keyposition interface. Or alternatively, users directly manipulate joint positions one-at-a-time along the manipulator and solve the inverse kinematics problem based on the pseudoinverse Jacobian matrix, referred to as Nullspace interface. A non-expert user study is conducted to compare and the quality of the obtained redundancy resolution between Cartesian and Nullspace interfaces. The results show superior performance of the Keyposition approach in terms of teaching redundancy resolution to avoid collisions with the constraint environment based on users' intuitive knowledge. And the study is furthermore accompanied by in-depth interviews with domain experts for overall evaluation and further improvement. © 2018 KASHYAP.},

The algorithm processes the 3D medical data in scan-line order and calculates triangle vertices using linear interpolation. We find the gradient of the original data, normalize it, and use it as a basis for shading the models. The detail in images produced from the generated surface models is the result of maintaining the inter-slice connectivity, surface data, and gradient information present in the original 3D data. Results from computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR), and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) illustrate the quality and functionality of marching cubes. We also discuss improvements that decrease processing time and add solid modeling capabilities.},

The approach presented here is to determine the re quired joint angle rates for the manipulator under the con straints of multiple goals, the primary goal described by the specified end-effector trajectory and secondary goals describ ing the obstacle avoidance criteria. The decomposition of the solution into a particular and a homogeneous component effectively illustrates the priority of the multiple goals that is exact end-effector control with redundant degrees of freedom maximizing the distance to obstacles.

of the resulting tree. It has been shown that an important element in achieving efficient query
times for approximate queries is that each cell should be fat, meaning that the ratio of its longest
side to shortest side (its aspect ratio) should be bounded. Subdivisions with fat cells satisfy a
property called the packing constraint, which bounds the number of disjoint cells of a given size
that can overlap a ball of a given radius. We consider a splitting rule called the sliding-midpoint
rule. It has been shown to provide efficient search times for approximate nearest neighbor and
range searching, both in practice and in terms of expected case query time. However it has not
been possible to prove results about this tree because it can produce cells of unbounded aspect
ratio. We show that in spite of this, the sliding-midpoint rule generates subdivisions that satisfy
the packing constraint, thus explaining their good performance.},

  abstract  = {Kinematic redundancy is a characteristic and beneficial property in collaborative robots nowadays as it enhances the flexibility and dexterity of the system. While the robot is manipulating an object, it is often necessary to kinematically reconfigure the robot, for example, when it obstructs the human. For this, internal or so-called null space motions can be carried out which do not affect the main task. In general, it is desirable that the human coworker can anticipate how the robot will move at any time. However, for null space motions this is typically not the case as they are non-intuitive and not suitable for interaction. In this work, we develop intuitive null space interaction behaviors for redundant manipulators, where the human can easily guide the robot. We want to provide users with a tool, that is straightforward to implement and solves real-world problems effectively. Two practical applications for an eight- and ten-DOF robot demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.},

  abstract  = {Ensuring safety is a primary goal in physical human-robot interaction. In various collision experiments it was found that the robot's effective mass, velocity, and geometry are the key parameters which influence the human injury severity during an impact. Recently, a velocity controller was proposed that limits the robot speed to a biomechanically safe value, taking into account the mass and the curvature in the direction of movement for a given point of interest. The mass and the geometry depend on the mechanical design, however, the effective mass also depends on the robot configuration. In this paper, we exploit the redundant degree(s) of freedom of a joint torque controlled seven- and eight-DOF robot to minimize the effective mass without affecting the desired
Cartesian end-effector trajectory and with the goal to improve the performance of the safe velocity controller at the same time. Given recent results in robotics injury analysis, we analyze when such a redundancy resolution scheme actually improves safety. For the considered robots, we find reflected mass extrema that can be obtained by null space motions, and propose a real-time, torque-based redundancy resolution scheme, which is finally verified in experiments.},

By exploiting the redundant degrees of freedom, auxiliary null space tasks can be carried out in addition to the primary task. Such auxiliary tasks are often formulated in terms of a performance or safety criterion that shall be minimized. If the optimization criterion, however, is defined in global terms, then it is directly affected by the primary task. As a consequence, the task achievement of the auxiliary task may be unnecessarily detrimented by the main task. In addition to modifying the primary task via constraint relaxation, a possible solution for improving the performance of the auxiliary task is to relax the primary task temporarily via time scaling. This gives the null space task more time for achieving its objective. In this paper, we propose several such time scaling schemes and verify their performance for a DLR/KUKA Lightweight Robot with one redundant degree of freedom. Finally, we extend the concept to multiple prioritized tasks and provide a simulation example.},

It acquires these strategies through reinforcement learning from local sensory data. The controller has two reinforcement-based modules: a module for negotiating obstacles and a module for moving to the goal. Both modules generate actions that are interpreted with regard to a goal vector in the robot joint space. A differential inverse kinematics (DIV) module is used to obtain such a goal vector. The DIV module is based on the inversion of a neural network that has been previously trained to approximate the manipulator forward kinematics in polar coordinates. The controller achieves a satisfactory performance quite rapidly and shows good generalization capabilities in the face of new environments.},

  abstract    = {The assembly of large structures, especially modular ones, can be automated using a robot to carry out the process. This can reduce the costs of construction and maintenance of the structures. However, such task brings additional challenges for an automatic planning system. This thesis presents the study and implementation of a hybrid planning system for the demonstration of an in-space robotic assembly of telescopes using segmented mirror tiles. The work was developed within the framework of the EU project Prototype for an Ultra Large Structure Assembly Robot (PULSAR) partially carried out at the German Aeroespace Center (DLR) in Oberpfafenhoffen, Germany.

The use of larger telescopes is an increasingly important requirement in the field of astronomy. However, there is a technological limit for producing primary mirrors made of a
single rigid piece. Creating a single-piece large reflective surface is normally more expensive than building an array of smaller mirrors designed to act as segments of a primary mirror of the same size. Such problem is especially noticeable for space-based telescopes, where the cargo areas of launch vehicles provide an upper limit for the maximum aperture of the telescope. A possible solution is in-space assembly, making use of a highly autonomous
robotic system that directly constructs the structure on orbit. 

The proposed autonomous assembly planner, takes into consideration different constraints. On the one hand, robot physical constraints such as joint limits, maximum joint torques, and the moments of inertia of the sub-assemblies must be considered. On the other hand, semantic
constraints on the types of connections between the tiles must be specified to ensure the mechanical stability and data connectivity within the structure. The final assembly sequence to be executed is selected by minimizing a desired cost function. In order to generate a plan that considers these physical constraints, a hybrid assembly planner with two layers is defined. The global layer uses graph search strategies to explore a graph representation of possible assembly sequences, ensuring that the potential solutions fulfill all the semantic constraints describing the allowed connections between standard interfaces. The local layer uses a constrained path planning algorithm combined with a dynamic simulation to ensure that the transitions between states (representing sub-assemblies) fulfill
the required physical constraints.

The planner is integrated into a physical ground-based demonstrator for autonomous robotic assembly of mirror tiles. Simulations demonstrate that our approach is still valid for larger telescope structures. In order to illustrate the flexibility of the planner, different physical constraints and optimization goals were implemented and verified.},

Once started on a shallow slope, a machine of this class will settle into a steady gait quite comparable to human walking, without active control or en ergy input. Interpretation and analysis of the physics are straightforward; the walking cycle, its stability, and its sensi tivity to parameter variations are easily calculated. Experi ments with a test machine verify that the passive walking effect can be readily exploited in practice. The dynamics are most clearly demonstrated by a machine powered only by gravity, but they can be combined easily with active energy input to produce efficient and dextrous walking over a broad range of terrain.},

Building upon previous work in discrete geometry, these operators are closely related to the continuous case, guaranteeing an appropriate extension from the continuous to the discrete setting: they respect most intrinsic properties of the continuous differential operators. We show that these estimates are optimal in accuracy under mild smoothness conditions, and demonstrate their numerical quality. We also present applications of these operators, such as mesh smoothing, enhancement, and quality checking, and show results of denoising in higher dimensions, such as for tensor images.},

  abstract = {This article reviews theory and applications of Koopman modes in fluid mechanics. Koopman mode decomposition is based on the surprising fact, discovered in Mezić (2005), that normal modes of linear oscillations have their natural analogs—Koopman modes—in the context of nonlinear dynamics. To pursue this analogy, one must change the representation of the system from the state-space representation to the dynamics governed by the linear Koopman operator on an infinite-dimensional space of observables. Whereas Koopman in his original paper dealt only with measure-preserving transformations, the discussion here is predominantly on dissipative systems arising from Navier-Stokes evolution. The analysis is based on spectral properties of the Koopman operator. Aspects of point and continuous parts of the spectrum are discussed. The point spectrum corresponds to isolated frequencies of oscillation present in the fluid flow, and also to growth rates of stable and unstable modes. The continuous part of the spectrum corresponds to chaotic motion on the attractor. A method of computation of the spectrum and the associated Koopman modes is discussed in terms of generalized Laplace analysis. When applied to a generic observable, this method uncovers the full point spectrum. A computational alternative is given by Arnoldi-type methods, leading to so-called dynamic mode decomposition, and I discuss the connection and differences between these two methods. A number of applications are reviewed in which decompositions of this type have been pursued. Koopman mode theory unifies and provides a rigorous background for a number of different concepts that have been advanced in fluid mechanics, including global mode analysis, triple decomposition, and dynamic mode decomposition.},

This is a Riemannian metric on ℝ2 if h ⩾ 0 or on a disk D ⊂  ℝ2 if h < 0. The metric is singular at the origin (the collision singularity) and also on the boundary of the disk when h < 0. The Kepler problem and the corresponding metric are invariant under rotations of the plane and it is natural to wonder whether the metric can be realized as a surface of revolution in ℝ3 or some other simple space. In this note, we use elementary methods to study the geometry of the Kepler metric and the embedding problem. Embeddings of the metrics with h ⩾ 0 as surfaces of revolution in ℝ3 are constructed explicitly but no such embedding exists for h < 0 due to a problem near the boundary of the disk. We prove a theorem showing that the same problem occurs for every analytic central force potential. Returning to the Kepler metric, we rule out embeddings in the three-sphere or hyperbolic space, but succeed in constructing an embedding in four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. Indeed, there are many such embeddings.},

In this paper, we propose a new approach for solving one of these key aspects: the solution to the forward kinematics in real-time, an under-defined problem with a high-degree nonlinear formulation, using a popular machine learning method for classification and regression, the Support Vector Machines. Instead of solving a numerical problem, the proposed method involves applying Support Vector Regression to model the behavior of a platform in a given region or partition of the pose space. It consists of two phases, an off-line preprocessing step and a fast on-line evaluation phase. The experiments made have yielded a good approximation to the analytical solution, and have shown its suitability for real-time application. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This article presents a class of generalized inverses that have the property of being integrable within any sim ply connected, nonsingular region of the work space. Inte grability is obtained by deriving the equations that describe an externally imposed motion, with the hypothe sis that a compliance function is associated with each degree of freedom of the manipulator. The result is a weighted pseudoinverse containing a term that accounts for the nonlinear features of the forward kinematics. The relation of this integrable weighted pseudoinverse to the standard Moore-Penrose and other weighted pseudo- inverses is discussed.},

We introduce the concept of task priority in relation to the inverse kinematic problem of redundant robot manipulators. A required task is divided into subtasks according to the order of priority. We propose to determine the joint motions of robot manipulators so that subtasks with lower priority can be performed utilizing re dundancy on subtasks with higher priority. This procedure is formulated using the pseudoinverses of Jacobian matrices. Most problems of redundancy utilization can be formulated in the framework of tasks with the order of priority. The results of numerical simulations and experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed redundancy control scheme.},

  abstract = {Dexterous manipulation with a highly redundant movement system is one of the hallmarks of human motor skills. From numerous behavioral studies, there is strong evidence that humans employ compliant task space control, i.e. they focus control only on task variables while keeping redundant degrees-of-freedom as compliant as possible. This strategy is robust towards unknown disturbances and simultaneously safe for the operator and the environment. The theory of operational space control in robotics aims to achieve similar performance properties. However, despite various compelling theoretical lines of research, advanced operational space control is hardly found in actual robotics implementations, in particular new kinds of robots like humanoids and service robots, which would strongly profit from compliant dexterous manipulation. To analyze the pros and cons of different approaches to operational space control, this paper focuses on a theoretical and empirical evaluation of different methods that have been suggested in the literature, but also some new variants of operational space controllers. We address formulations at the velocity, acceleration, and force levels. First, we formulate all controllers in a common notational framework, including quaternion-based orientation control, and discuss some of their theoretical properties. Second, we present experimental comparisons of these approaches on a seven-degree-of-freedom anthropomorphic robot arm with several benchmark tasks. As an aside, we also introduce a novel parameter estimation algorithm for rigid body dynamics, which ensures physical consistency, as this issue was crucial for our successful robot implementations. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that one of the simplified acceleration-based approaches can be advantageous in terms of task performance, ease of parameter tuning, and general robustness and compliance in the face of inevitable modeling errors.},

  abstract  = {Structure-borne sound is an interesting sensory modality for inferring contact information in robotics due to comparatively cheap sensor hardware, the possibility to integrate it into existing systems with little effort, and due to the richness of information in the acquired signals. In this work we investigate whether it is feasible to fit piezoelectric acoustic sensors on a robotic system in order to infer properties of objects during contact events. In contrast to existing works regarding object and material identification by evaluating sound the challenge in our experimental setup is that the sensor is integrated in the structure of the robot. Hence, the measured audio signal are not only governed by the acoustic properties of the objects, but are also strongly influenced by the changing resonance properties of the robot due to its kinematic configuration and the ego-noise during operation. We investigate whether it is possible to learn a classifier that is invariant and robust to these configuration dependent changes in the acquired audio signals. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach in two selected material classification experiments and compare the performance of a deep learning classifier to several baseline machine learning methods. We found out that a representation learning approach using a deep neural network shows the highest invariance to the changing acoustics properties and outperforms the baseline methods in our experiments. The results encourage the further investigation of structure-borne sound in robotic applications.},

  abstract = {Robotic assembly tasks are typically implemented in static settings in which parts are kept at fixed locations by making use of part holders. Very few works deal with the problem of moving parts in industrial assembly applications. However, having autonomous robots that are able to execute assembly tasks in dynamic environments could lead to more flexible facilities with reduced implementation efforts for individual products. In this paper, we present a general approach towards autonomous robotic assembly that combines visual and intrinsic tactile sensing to continuously track parts within a single Bayesian framework. Based on this, it is possible to implement object-centric assembly skills that are guided by the estimated poses of the parts, including cases where occlusions block the vision system. In particular, we investigate the application of this approach for peg-in-hole assembly. A tilt-and-align strategy is implemented using a Cartesian impedance controller, and combined with an adaptive path executor. Experimental results with multiple part combinations are provided and analyzed in detail.},

  abstract = {Examples are common in dynamical systems in which there are regions containing chaotic sets that are not attractors. If almost every trajectory eventually leaves some region, but the region contains a chaotic set, then typical trajectories will behave chaotically for a while and then will leave the region, and so we will observe chaotic transients. The main objective that will be addressed is the “Dynamic Restraint Problem”: Given a region that contains a chaotic set but does not contain an attractor, find a chaotic trajectory numerically that remains in the regionfor an arbituarily long period of time. Systems with horseshoes have such regions as do systems with fractal basin boundaries, as does the Hénon map for suitably chosen parameters. We present a numerical technique for finding trajectories which will stay in such chaotic sets for arbitrarily long periods of time, and it leads to a “saddle straddle trajectory”. The method is called the “PIM triple procedure” since it is based on so called PIM triples. A PIM (Proper Interior Maximum) triple is three points (a, c, b) in a straight line segment such that the interior point c (i.e. c is between a and b) has the maximum escape time, that is, its escape time from the region is greater than the escape time of both a and b. “Proper” means the segment from a to b is smaller than a previously obtained segment. We show rigorously that the PIM triple procedure works in ideal situations. We find it works well even in less than ideal cases. This procedure can also be used for the computation of Lyapunov exponents. Furthermore, the “accessible PIM triple procedure” (a refined PIM triple procedure for finding accessible trajectories on the chaotic saddle) will also be discussed.},

  abstract = {Passivity-based control (PBC) is a well-established technique that has shown to be very powerful to design robust controllers for physical systems described by Euler–Lagrange (EL) equations of motion. For regulation problems of mechanical systems, which can be stabilized “shaping” only the potential energy, PBC preserves the EL structure and furthermore assigns a closed-loop energy function equal to the difference between the energy of the system and the energy supplied by the controller. Thus, we say that stabilization is achieved via energy balancing. Unfortunately, these nice properties of EL–PBC are lost when used in other applications which require shaping of the total energy, for instance, in electrical or electromechanical systems, or even some underactuated mechanical devices. Our main objective in this paper is to develop a new PBC theory which extends to a broader class of systems the aforementioned energy-balancing stabilization mechanism and the structure invariance. Towards this end, we depart from the EL description of the systems and consider instead port-controlled Hamiltonian models, which result from the network modelling of energy-conserving lumped-parameter physical systems with independent storage elements, and strictly contain the class of EL models.},

The compliance control law is based on a new representation of the dynamics wherein specific null space velocity coordinates are introduced. These allow to efficiently exploit the kinematic redundancy according to the task hierarchy and lead to a dynamics formulation with block-diagonal inertia matrix. The compensation of velocity-dependent coupling terms between the tasks by an additional passive feedback action facilitates a stability analysis for the complete hierarchy based on semi-definite Lyapunov functions. No external forces have to be measured. Finally, the performance of the control approach is evaluated in experiments on a torque-controlled robot.},

  abstract      = {Inverse kinematics computation using an artificial neural network that learns the inverse kinematics of a robot arm has been employed by many researchers. However, the inverse kinematics system of typical robot arms with joint limits is a multi-valued and discontinuous function. Since it is difficult for a well-known multi-layer neural network to approximate such a function, a correct inverse kinematics model cannot be obtained by using a single neural network. In order to overcome the discontinuity of the inverse kinematics function, we proposed a novel modular neural network system that consists of a number of expert neural networks. Each expert approximates the continuous part of the inverse kinematics function. The proposed system uses the forward kinematics model for selection of experts. When the number of the experts increases, the computation time for calculating the inverse kinematics solution also increases without using the parallel computing system. In order to reduce the computation time, we propose a novel expert selection by using the performance prediction networks which directly calculate the performances of the experts.},

The paper demonstrates innovative approach in trajectory planning for mechanical systems via time-reversal symmetry. It also presents two case studies: mass-spring-damper and inverted pendulum on the cart. As real systems break the time-reversal symmetry, the authors of this work propose a unique method in order to overcome this drawback. It computes a feed-forward reference control signal and state trajectories. The proposed solution enables compensation for the effects of couplings, which break the time-symmetry by a special proposed measure. The method suppresses the overall open-loop accumulated error and produces high-quality favorable control and state trajectories. Furthermore, the existence of the designed control signal and state trajectories is guaranteed if the equations of the motion have a solution in the direct flow of time.},

  abstract   = {We present a computational inverse design method for a new class of surface-based
inflatable structure. Our deployable structures are fabricated by fusing together
two layers of inextensible sheet material along carefully selected curves. The fusing
curves form a network of tubular channels that can be inflated with air or other fluids.
When fully inflated, the initially flat surface assumes a programmed double-curved
shape and becomes stiff and load-bearing. We present a method that solves for the
layout of air channels that, when inflated, best approximate a given input design.
For this purpose, we integrate a forward simulation method for inflation with a gradient-based
optimization algorithm that continuously adapts the geometry of the air channels to
improve the design objectives. To initialize this non-linear optimization, we propose
a novel surface flattening algorithm. When a channel is inflated, it approximately
maintains its length, but contracts transversally to its main direction. Our algorithm
approximates this deformation behavior by computing a mapping from the 3D design surface
to the plane that allows for anisotropic metric scaling within the bounds realizable
by the physical system. We show a wide variety of inflatable designs and fabricate
several prototypes to validate our approach and highlight potential applications.},

Two issues need to be resolved for this mechanism, the forward kinematics and the inverse kinematics. The problem is to obtain the forward kinematics solution, which currently is achieved using a numerical technique, Newton-Raphson method. This technique, though closely approximates the solution to the problem, is computationally very intensive. Neural networks, with their inherent ability to approximate any unknown function and fast execution characteristics, have been employed as an attempt to obtain a real-time solution to this problem. Two concepts in neural networks, All Class One Network (ACON) and One Class One Network (OCON), have been investigated using the multi-layered perceptron with backpropagation learning algorithm. The experiments indicated that ACON is significantly better than OCON considering the network complexity, computational resource utilization, and better output parameter estimations.},

  abstract = {In this article we present a unified geometric treatment of robot dynamics. Using standard ideas from Lie groups and Rieman nian geometry, we formulate the equations of motion for an open chain manipulator both recursively and in closed form. The recursive formulation leads to an O(n) algorithm that ex presses the dynamics entirely in terms of coordinate-free Lie algebraic operations. The Lagrangian formulation also ex presses the dynamics in terms of these Lie algebraic operations and leads to a particularly simple set of closed-form equations, in which the kinematic and inertial parameters appear explic itly and independently of each other. The geometric approach permits a high-level, coordinate-free view of robot dynamics that shows explicitly some of the connections with the larger body of work in mathematics and physics. At the same time the resulting equations are shown to be computationally ef fective and easily differentiated and factored with respect to any of the robot parameters. This latter feature makes the ge ometric formulation attractive for applications such as robot design and calibration, motion optimization, and optimal control, where analytic gradients involving the dynamics are required.},

One reason of the still limited use of NNMs in structural dynamics is that their computation is often regarded as impractical. However, when resorting to numerical algorithms, we show that the NNM computation is possible with limited implementation effort, which paves the way to a practical method for determining the NNMs of nonlinear mechanical systems. The proposed algorithm relies on two main techniques, namely a shooting procedure and a method for the continuation of NNM motions. The algorithm is demonstrated using four different mechanical systems, a weakly and a strongly nonlinear two-degree-of-freedom system, a simplified discrete model of a nonlinear bladed disk and a nonlinear cantilever beam discretized by the finite element method.},

  abstract = {One of the most general frameworks for phrasing control problems for complex, redundant robots is operational-space control. However, while this framework is of essential importance for robotics and well understood from an analytical point of view, it can be prohibitively hard to achieve accurate control in the face of modeling errors, which are inevitable in complex robots (e.g. humanoid robots). In this paper, we suggest a learning approach for operational-space control as a direct inverse model learning problem. A first important insight for this paper is that a physically correct solution to the inverse problem with redundant degrees of freedom does exist when learning of the inverse map is performed in a suitable piecewise linear way. The second crucial component of our work is based on the insight that many operational-space controllers can be understood in terms of a constrained optimal control problem. The cost function associated with this optimal control problem allows us to formulate a learning algorithm that automatically synthesizes a globally consistent desired resolution of redundancy while learning the operational-space controller. From the machine learning point of view, this learning problem corresponds to a reinforcement learning problem that maximizes an immediate reward. We employ an expectation-maximization policy search algorithm in order to solve this problem. Evaluations on a three degrees-of-freedom robot arm are used to illustrate the suggested approach. The application to a physically realistic simulator of the anthropomorphic SARCOS Master arm demonstrates feasibility for complex high degree-of-freedom robots. We also show that the proposed method works in the setting of learning resolved motion rate control on a real, physical Mitsubishi PA-10 medical robotics arm.},

Moreover, mathematical models of biological processes frequently contain many poorly-known parameters. This paper describes techniques for computing periodic orbits in systems of hybrid differential-algebraic equations and parameter estimation methods for fitting these orbits to data. These techniques make extensive use of automatic differentiation to evaluate derivatives accurately and effciently for time integration, parameter sensitivities, root finding and optimization. The resulting algorithms allow periodic orbits to be computed to high accuracy using coarse discretizations. Derivative computations are carried out using a new automatic differentiation package called ADMC++ that provides derivatives and Taylor series coeficients of matrix-valued functions written in the MATLAB programming language. The algorithms are applied to a periodic orbit problem in rigid-body dynamics and a parameter estimation problem in neural oscillations.},

It is nontrivial to realize object perception and operational decisions autonomously, under the usual visual occlusion and real-time constraints of such tasks. In this paper, a Bayesian networks-based strategy is presented in order to seamlessly combine multiple heterogeneous senses data like humans. In the proposed strategy, an interactive exploration method implemented by hybrid Monte Carlo sampling algorithms and particle filtering is designed to identify the features’ estimated starting value, and the memory adjustment method and the inertial thinking method are introduced to correct the target position and shape features of the object respectively. Based on the Dempster–Shafer evidence theory (D-S theory), a fusion decision strategy is designed using probabilistic models of forces and positions, which guided the robot motion after each acquisition of the estimated features of the object. It also enables the robot to judge whether the desired operation target is achieved or the feature estimate needs to be updated. Meanwhile, the pliability model is introduced into repeatedly perform exploration, planning and execution steps to reduce interaction forces, the number of exploration. The effectiveness of the strategy is validated in simulations and in a physical robot task.},

This has given neural-network-training which usually requires iterative techniques a reputation for being very slow. In this paper various techniques of optimizing criterion function to train neural-network (the gradient method, variable-metric, conjugate-gradient) are investigated. These techniques are modified somewhat by the use of a one dimensional search to improve robustness and to accelerate convergence. In this comparative study we used these algorithms to learn the forward and the inverse coordinate transformation of two degrees freedom (DOF) robot arm. The simulations show that the variable-metric combined with a one dimensional optimization provides a variety of benefits learning speed and minimizes the iteration number. The result shows better learning of forward and inverse kinematic robot model and significant reduction of learning time was obtained.},

the advent of mixed criticality computing, and the necessity of reducing costs are
leading to an increase in the interest for employing COTS hardware in real-time domains.
In this scenario, the Linux kernel is emerging as a valuable solution on the software
side, thanks to the rich support for hardware devices and peripherals, along with
a well-established programming environment. However, Linux has been developed as a
general-purpose operating system, followed by several approaches to introduce actual
real-time capabilities in the kernel. Among these, the PREEMPT_RT patch, developed
by the kernel maintainers, has the goal to increase the predictability and reduce
the latencies of the kernel directly modifying the existent kernel code. This article
aims at providing a survey of the state-of-the-art approaches for building real-time
Linux-based systems, with a focus on PREEMPT_RT, its evolution, and the challenges
that should be addressed in order to move PREEMPT_RT one step ahead. Finally, we present
some applications and use cases that have already benefited from the introduction
of this patch.},

inference. Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior
approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or
other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact
on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach
for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions.
Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby
a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence
of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We
use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal
flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations.
We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match
the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches,
provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.},

  abstract = {Due to shorter product life cycles and increasing customization, production lines must be able to quickly adapt to novel product variants. This requires the automatic generation of assembly sequence plans from product specifications, as manual engineering of plans is slow and labor intensive. The main challenge in assembly planning is that the search for a valid plan must take the capabilities of the robotic system that will execute the plan into account. But checking the feasibility of executing a plan requires a simulation of the system, which slows down the search for a valid and executable plan. We therefore propose and implement two ideas to reduce search times. First, we iteratively refine the feasibility check of an assembly plan from levels taking only parts into account (which is fast) to high-fidelity levels including motion planning and full robotic simulations (which is high fidelity, but slow). Slower levels are only checked if faster levels succeed. The second is that errors in these levels are propagated upwards as symbolic rules that prune the search tree. We demonstrate how our contributions reduce the need for high-fidelity simulations on a two-armed robotic system that assembles product variants out of aluminum profiles.},

The study of the vibrations of nonlinear systems with many degrees of freedom is concerned with the search for some or all periodic solutions of systems of nonlinear differential equations and to deduce as many properties of these solutions as the state of the applicable mathematical knowledge permits. Unfortunately, this body of knowledge is limited and not unified; in consequence, many and vaned disciplines within mathematics are commonly used to deduce partial results. In a general way, these results fall into two broad categories: those which apply to systems that are “weakly nonlinear,” and those which apply when the systems are “strongly nonlinear.” The results in the first category contain a good deal of detailed information, and they resemble in many ways those familiar from linear theory. Those in the latter category usually contain fewer details, being more concerned with general questions of existence, uniqueness, boundedness, and stability of solutions.},

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},

  abstract = {We investigate the role of lower leg muscle-tendon structures in providing serial elastic behavior to the hip actuator. We present a leg design with physical elastic elements in leg angle and virtual leg axis direction, and its impact onto energy efficient legged locomotion. By testing and comparing two robotic lower leg spring configurations, we can provide potential explanations of the functionality of similar animal leg morphologies with lower leg muscle-tendon network structures. We investigate the effects of leg angle compliance during locomotion. In a proof of concept, we show that a leg with a gastrocnemius inspired elasticity possesses elastic components that deflect in leg angle directions. The leg design with elastic elements in leg angle direction can store hip actuator energy in the series elastic element. We then show the leg's advantages in mechanical design in a vertical drop experiment. In the drop experiments the biarticular leg requires 46% less power. During drop loading, the leg adapts its posture and stores the energy in its springs. The increased energy storing capacity in leg angle direction reduces energy requirements and cost of transport by 31% during dynamic hopping to a cost of transport of 1.2 at 0.9 kg body weight. The biarticular robot leg design has major advantages, especially compared to more traditional robot designs. Despite its high degree of under-actuation, it is easy to converge into and maintain dynamic hopping locomotion. The presented control is based on a simple-to-implement, feed-forward pattern generator. The biarticular legs lightweight design can be rapidly assembled and is largely made from elements created by rapid prototyping. At the same time it is robust, and passively withstands drops from 200% body height. The biarticular leg shows, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the lowest achieved relative cost of transport documented for all dynamically hopping and running robots of 64% of a comparable natural runner's COT.},

  abstract = {Conventional robotics programming is affected by specification and computation of poses in three-
dimensional space. In all robotic fields engineers must know about rigid body kinematics and spatial
transformations. A comparatively new approach is the specification of motions and tasks by means of
object’s names instead of poses. At runtime names can be resolved to concrete transformations by
database resolution. Another important benefit in using object’s names is the usability in artificial
intelligence concerning robotics. As soon as a robotics system knows a name of any object and not
exclusively poses, there is much more knowledge about the world’s state that can be used in AI agents
or similar systems for high level reasoning on a symbolic level. Tasks and motions can be described on
an abstract level and it is easier to perform automated creation of tasks and sequences.
In such a robotic system there needs to be a central knowledge database to resolve names to spatial
pose information. That database has to be filled with these. The first part of this report will develop
a method to register objects in an object’s database. Spatial transformations are determined using
the robots forward kinematics itself. Objects are grasped with the robot’s gripper and the robot is
moved to the object’s pose using gravitation compensation mode. In that process many samples are
generated and a single transformation is computed by developed methods.
The second part develops a method to perform automated robot-world calibration for multiple robots.
A calibration frame is placed in the world and all robots grasp it autonomously on multiple points,
which are related by a geometric plane constraint. Eventually the robot’s pose in the world is estimated
based on observations made during autonomous grasping.},

  abstract = {The information about the accurate position and orientation of an object relative to a
robot plays a fundamental role in robotic manipulation. Registration refers to the process
of determining that so-called object pose. Generally, registration is performed manually
and must be executed with high precision. For flexible systems, an automated approach,
where the robotic system determines poses of objects automatically is desirable. This
work proposes a visual-tactile feature-based approach for object registration.
Features describe distinctive properties of objects that can be observed by sensors.
By using a Bayesian inference approach, the system explicitly models hypotheses and
uncertainties of feature poses and infers the hidden world state from measurements. In
this work, recursive state estimation is used in order to fuse visual and tactile data.
In particular, a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm, namely a particle filter, is applied.
Additionally, periodically the belief on the current world state is analysed in order to
detect and characterise uncertainties. Based on that, uncertainty lowering strategies are
selected, parametrised and automatically executed by the robot.
Eventually, the approach is experimentally validated within a robotic work cell. There-
fore, hole-shaped features of objects are used. Comparison of solely visual and fused
visual-tactile results shows that the addition of tactile measurements and entropy redu-
cing strategies increases information and lowers the uncertainty of the believed world
state significantly. At the same time better feature poses for object registration are
generated.},

  abstract = {In order to interact with objects or other robots, a robot system essentially requires precise
information on the poses of objects. In this report a completely automatic calibration
method is proposed. By combining optic and haptic sensory measurements, the poses of
the robots in a world frame are estimated. Basically a camera system mounted in the
work cell, detects graspable features visually and by transforming the poses of detected
features into the base frame of the robot, the features can be investigated haptically.
Therefore, advantage of stiffness control and tactile capabilities of the robot, is made to
improve the estimates. Haptic alignment to the object is done using impedance controllers.
Thus, optical inaccuracies are compensated haptically. Based on measurements, the robot
took during haptic investigation, the robot pose can be estimated, using knowledge about
the location of the features in the work cell. As no a priori knowledge on the kinematic
configuration is available, also an automatic robot to camera calibration is developed and
implemented. As object and optic feature recognition is not the main task of this report,
it is substituted by a visual marker system, that replaces tough recognition algorithms.
Additionally a graphical user interface to the implemented methods is developed. It
provides a set of calibration assistants, whose objective is to guide the operator through
the calibration process intuitively.},

A shared computer vision system provides locations of the robots and the ball for both

in the images of multiple cameras placed above the field. Generally, pose information is
determined based on the constraint that all objects share the same plane in the world.
Indeed that is true for robots as they usually don’t fly. The planar constraint is used for
the ball as well, which is resulting in wrong locations and so-called virtual balls. These
location information and corresponding timestamps provided by the shared computer
vision system are used by the TIGERs’ filter algorithms to predict the future state of
the ball. In this work an algorithm is developed that reconstructs the ball trajectories in

This is essential to generate control inputs that decrease or increase the amplitude of the nonlinear oscillations.

Concepts of equilibrium points, linearization, stability, and Poincar{\'e} maps are treated. Afterward, chaotic dynamics is explored. Horseshoe transformation is discussed in order to define the main aspects of chaos. Fractal characteristics are presented and discussed. Routes to chaos are investigated showing some definitions of bifurcation. Lyapunov exponents are defined presenting a diagnostic tool for chaos. The main concepts and tools are then presented by considering a case study related to a shape memory alloy system. Single and two degrees of freedom systems are treated using a polynomial constitutive model to describe the restitution forces.},

  abstract = {To control highly-dynamic compliant motions such as running or hopping, vertebrates rely on reflexes and Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) as core strategies. However, decoding how much each strategy contributes to the control and how they are adjusted under different conditions is still a major challenge. To help solve this question, the present paper provides a comprehensive comparison of reflexes, CPGs and a commonly used combination of the two applied to a biomimetic robot. It leverages recent findings indicating that in mammals both control principles act within a low-dimensional control submanifold. This substantially reduces the search space of parameters and enables the quantifiable comparison of the different control strategies. The chosen metrics are motion stability and energy efficiency, both key aspects for the evolution of the central nervous system. We find that neither for stability nor energy efficiency it is favorable to apply the state-of-the-art approach of a continuously feedback-adapted CPG. In both aspects, a pure reflex is more effective, but the pure CPG allows easy signal alteration when needed. Additionally, the hardware experiments clearly show that the shape of a control signal has a strong influence on energy efficiency, while previous research usually only focused on frequency alignment. Both findings suggest that currently used methods to combine the advantages of reflexes and CPGs can be improved. In future research, possible combinations of the control strategies should be reconsidered, specifically including the modulation of the control signal's shape. For this endeavor, the presented setup provides a valuable benchmark framework to enable the quantitative comparison of different bioinspired control principles.},

  year     = {2004},
  abstract = {In the future, there will be a big market potential for service applications, as for example in the support of elderly or disabled people, in the areas of cleaning, security, in space etc. In all these areas, robots which are flexible to use will be required, since in such tasks not everything can be planned, foreseen, or apriori simulated. In such applications robots will be needed which are light but can exert forces, efficiently avoid collisions, and interact with humans while executing their tasks, e.g., support a load and react to direct touch. Kinematically redundant robots fit best to these kinds of requirements due to their additional degrees of freedom, allowing them to fulfill varying task requirements and environmental changes. Various different methods, algorithms, and techniques have been developed in the handling of kinematically redundant robots. Analogous to earlier days, when interpolators, kinematics, inverse kinematics, and so on have been put into a framework of robot controllers, thus allowing the breakthrough for industrial robots. The aim of this thesis is to create a framework for redundant robots. There is a gap between current research in redundant robotics and a user friendly intuitive redundant robot controller, allowing a non-expert user to teach and handle the redundant degrees of freedom (DoF). In this thesis, a concept for utilization and interactive handling of redundant robots is created. Due to the fact that the additional degrees of freedom can be used for different, possibly contradictory purposes, the choice of these purposes itself is highly task dependent. This thesis consists of two main parts. In the first part redundancy resolution algorithms are reviewed, one of which is selected and investigated in detail for different purposes such as singularity handling, redundancy resolution, interactive behavior, and so on. In the second part a system architecture is outlined and a user interface concept defined, with which a non user will be able to use and interact with kinematically redundant robots. A review of redundancy resolution algorithms from the literature shows that there does not exist a single "best" algorithm. Therefore an all service robot should embed different algorithms. Furthermore, with the choice of constraint optimization algorithms instead of the widely used Moore, limits of real systems such as actuator saturation can be easily enforced. An additional positive effect is that non constraints on joints can be easily embedded. There exist algorithms which reliably solve convex optimization problems in . The handling of singularities exploits the features of constraint optimization by formulating a linear leastsquares problem with linear equality and inequality constraints. Singularity handling is studied for the case of nonindustry robots and extended to redundant mechanisms. In the extension to redundancy resolution additional cost-functions are added to the optimization problem. Various different cost functions are discussed in detail within this thesis, e.g., joint limit avoidance, dexterity enhancement, collision avoidance, and interactive cost functions. The topic of point-to-point motion is covered, since the solution of iterative algorithms converge quickly only in a narrow space, which is useful while tracking a trajectory. For the example of catching a flying ball, these methods are discussed in detail. An additonal topic is the concept of intuitive interactive self motion, which enables the user to teach a task to a redundant robot. In contrast to teaching non robots, where it is sufficient to move the end effector, the redundancy has to be considered while teaching. The interactive concept is then extended to execution, which is studied for the example of an inverse pendulum. A concept for the system architecture is developed, which allows to embed multiple algorithms, to flexibly extend features and to provide the necessary data for the components. Various different scenarios, including real systems with manipulators containing up to 10 DoF are investigated. Here, the constraint optimization is used for controlling a mobile manipulator with nonholonomic constraints in realtime.},

Behavioral primitives are entities for the control of various movement criteria, e.g. primitives describing the behavior of the center of gravity, the behaviors of the hands, legs, and head, the body attitude and posture, the constrained body parts such as joint-limits and contacts, etc. By aggregating multiple primitives, we synthesize whole-body behaviors. For safety and for efficient control, we establish a control hierarchy among behavioral primitives, which is exploited to establish control priorities among the different control categories, i.e. constraints, operational tasks, and postures. Constraints should always be guaranteed, while operational tasks should be accomplished without violating the acting constraints, and the posture should control the residual movement redundancy. In this paper, we will present a multi-level hierarchical control structure that allows the establishment of general priorities among behavioral primitives, and we will describe compliant control strategies for efficient control under contact interactions.},

  year        = {2019},
  abstract    = {Nature evolved legs to travel in difficult terrain. Biological legged locomotion displays different gaits to minimize the energy needed to move with certain
velocities. For example, humans walk with low velocity but switch to running when moving faster. Robotic legged locomotion proves to be a challenging topic. Most state-of-the-art motion planning approaches heavily control legged robotic systems in order to perform aspired movements. Changing the intrinsic dynamics of the system through control is necessary since the dynamics do not inherently exhibit the desired motions. However, recent work suggests that embedding desired dynamics into segmented robotic legs reduces the necessity of extensive control.

This Master's Thesis combines theoretical templates for legged locomotion with physically realizable robotic legs. It first presents energy-conservative spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) models, which explain the existence of different gaits in legged locomotion. These templates are modified to capture the effects of physical damping and ground contact dynamics. A minimal control action compensates the resulting energy losses. Hereby, several natural gaits could be displayed with a non-conservative SLIP model. Based on this newly developed model, a segmented leg featuring a pantograph mechanism is designed. The inherent dynamics of this robotic leg are matched with the SLIP dynamics of the non-conservative template model. Based on optimized design parameters, the influence of deviating parameters on the natural dynamics is analyzed. These imprecisions occur when physically realizing the robotic leg.

Natural gaits can be transferred from energy-conservative SLIP models to non-conservative models. SLIP-like dynamics are embedded into segmented legs, which can reduce the control necessary to exhibit periodic motions. Gaits supported by the intrinsic dynamics result in reduced energy consumption.},

  abstract = {cient and robust locomotion is a crucial condition for the more extensive use of legged robots in real world applications. In that respect, robots can learn from animals, if the principles underlying locomotion in biological legged systems can be transferred to their artificial counterparts. However, legged locomotion in biological systems is a complex and not fully understood problem. A great progress to simplify understanding locomotion dynamics and control was made by introducing simple models, coined ``templates'', able to represent the overall dynamics of animal (including human) gaits. One of the most recognized models is the spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP) which consists of a point mass atop a massless spring. This model provides a good description of human gaits, such as walking, hopping and running. Despite its high level of abstraction, it supported and inspired the development of successful legged robots and was used as explicit targets for control, over the years.	 				 Inspired from template models explaining biological locomotory systems and Raibert's pioneering legged robots, locomotion can be realized by basic subfunctions: (i) stance leg function, (ii) leg swinging and (iii) balancing. Combinations of these three subfunctions can generate different gaits with diverse properties. Using the template models, we investigate how locomotor subfunctions contribute to stabilize different gaits (hopping, running and walking) in different conditions (e.g., speeds). We show that such basic analysis on human locomotion using conceptual models can result in developing new methods in design and control of legged systems like humanoid robots and assistive devices (exoskeletons, orthoses and prostheses).		  This thesis comprises research in different disciplines: biomechanics, robotics and control. These disciplines are required to do human experiments and data analysis, modeling of locomotory systems, and implementation on robots and an exoskeleton. We benefited from facilities and experiments performed in the Lauflabor locomotion laboratory. Modeling includes two categories: conceptual (template-based, e.g. SLIP) models and detailed models (with segmented legs, masses/inertias). Using the BioBiped series of robots (and the detailed BioBiped MBS models; MBS stands for Multi-Body-System), we have implemented newly-developed design and control methods related to the concept of locomotor subfunctions on either MBS models or on the robot directly. In addition, with involvement in BALANCE project ({$\backslash$}url\{http://balance-fp7.eu/\}), we implemented balance-related control approaches on an exoskeleton to demonstrate their performance in human walking. The outcomes of this research includes developing new conceptual models of legged locomotion, analysis of human locomotion based on the newly developed models following the locomotor subfunction trilogy, developing methods to benefit from the models in design and control of robots and exoskeletons. The main contribution of this work is providing a novel approach for modular control of legged locomotion. With this approach we can identify the relation between different locomotor subfunctions e.g., between balance and stance (using stance force for tuning balance control) or balance and swing (two joint hip muscles can support the swing leg control relating it to the upper body posture) and implement the concept of modular control based on locomotor subfunctions with a limited exchange of sensory information on several hardware platforms (legged robots, exoskeleton).},

Consider the set of natural numbers in which the following relationship is introduced: n1 precedes n2 (n1 ≼ n2) if for any continuous mapping of the real line into itself the existence of a cycle of order n2 follows from the existence of a cycle of order n1.

  abstract  = {{Mobile manipulation is a hot topic of research due to the increased flexibility in tasks they offer. However, ‘true’ mobile manipulation, that is seamless integration and synchronization of mobility and manipulation is rarely performed in a standard industrial or service robotics scenario. Even though, there is huge demand for such applications for example, a mobile robot applying sealant on a large aircraft wing, off the shelf solutions are missing. The reason being, basic challenges like positioning of mobile platform for a task, dealing with redundancies from a planning and control point of view, a repeatable fast inverse kinematics and dealing with high dimensional Configuration space of the highly redundant mobile robot are still not solved. In this paper we present a novel and generalized algorithm to solve inverse kinematics for mobile manipulators in closed form. We also define reusable, generalized redundancy parameters which have meaning in the task space. The algorithm is implemented on the real-time KUKA Sunrise robot controller and Nullspace motions have been performed on our 12 DOF Valeri robot.}},

  abstract = {A methodology is presented which extends to non-linear systems the concept of normal modes of motion which is well developed for linear systems. The method is constructive for weakly non-linear systems and provides the physical nature of the normal modes along with the non-linear differential equations which govern their dynamics. It also provides the non-linear co-ordinate transformation which relates the original system co-ordinates to the modal co-ordinates. Using this transformation, we demonstrate how an approximate non-linear version of superposition can be employed to reconstruct the overall motion from the individual non-linear modal dynamics. The results presented herein for non-linear systems reduce to modal analysis for the linearized system when non-linearities are neglected, even though the approach is entirely different from the traditional one. The tools employed are from the theory of invariant manifolds for dynamical systems and were inspired by the center manifold reduction technique. In this paper the basic ideas are outlined, a few examples are presented and some natural extensions and applications of the method are briefly described in the conclusions.},

  abstract = {Minimisation methods for training feedforward networks with back propagation are compared. Feedforward neural network training is a special case of function minimisation, where no explicit model of the data is assumed. Therefore, and due to the high dimensionality of the data, linearisation of the training problem through use of orthogonal basis functions is not desirable. The focus is on function minimisation on any basis. Quasi-Newton and conjugate gradient methods are reviewed, and the latter are shown to be a special case of error back propagation with momentum term. Three feedforward learning problems are tested with five methods. It is shown that, due to the fixed stepsize, standard error back propagation performs well in avoiding local minima. However, by using not only the local gradient but also the second derivative of the error function, a much shorter training time is required. Conjugate gradient with Powell restarts shows to be the superior method.},

General neural network approaches use data of the end-effector positions as an input and angle joints as an output to train the neural network for mapping the input to the output. However, the proposed method creates the custom networks from forward kinematic equations. This special structure makes the network like a position finder with ability to automatically adjust angle joints until the end-effector reaches the desired position by backpropagation with variable learning rate algorithm. Then, the solutions of angles can be found from the final weights and bias values. Moreover, the proposed network use less number of neurons and amount of the solution space is not depend on the training data.

This paper creates neural networks to represent x, y and z position of the end-effector in the forward kinematics equations. The structure of the network has 4 layers; input layer, 2 hidden layers, and output layer. The input and output layers are defined as robotic arm angle and position of the end-effector, respectively. Then, the network updates the weights by the backpropagation with variable learning rate algorithm until reaching criteria that the output of the network is equal to the desired positions. Finally, the inverse kinematics solution is defined by the optimal weights of the network.

As computation time is a major issue, we are interested in applying model order reduction techniques to such multibody systems. One possible method called Proper Orthogonal Decomposition is based on minimizing the displacements euclidian distance while the more recently presented method Smooth Orthogonal Decomposition considers not only displacements but also their time derivatives. After a short introduction to the theory, this contribution presents a comparison of both methods on an index-reduced system. The methods are tested against each other in order to identify advantages and disadvantages.},

It is shown that they suffer from non-invariance in the sense that arbitrariness in the choice of the metric functions employed in their definition is unavoidable and they are not invariant under changes of the arbitrary choices introduced. Since there do not exist natural norms in the spaces of generalized forces and velocities, kinematic manipulability is neither an invariant concept nor a natural notion.},

Arjan is one of the Godfathers in this way of thinking and he has been a pioneer in bringing these concepts to a new level, introducing proper geometry, a sound system theoretic basis and divulgating these issues. This chapter shows how, by using these concepts, it is possible to address or solve certain problems in robotics, control and passivity in a simple and straightforward way. It also presents a formal proof of a claim which is often used as a conjecture and which gives theoretical arguments to counteract the statement which is often used against passivity and saying that passivity is too restrictive and stability is what should be looked for. Many of the concepts reported in the chapter have been the results of discussions with Arjan or are still issues that I am working on with Arjan. It is a great pleasure and honour to have the opportunity to contribute in this way to a recognition of the incredible career of a college and friend for which I have incredible respect from an intellectual and personal point of view.},

  abstract = {There are multiple indications that the nervous system of animals tunes muscle output to exploit natural dynamics of the elastic locomotor system and the environment. This is an advantageous strategy especially in fast periodic movements, since the elastic elements store energy and increase energy efficiency and movement speed. Experimental evidence suggests that coordination among joints involves proprioceptive input and neuromodulatory influence originating in the brain stem. However, the neural strategies underlying the coordination of fast periodic movements remain poorly understood. Based on robotics control theory, we suggest that the nervous system implements a mechanism to accomplish coordination between joints by a linear coordinate transformation from the multi-dimensional space representing proprioceptive input at the joint level into a one-dimensional controller space. In this one-dimensional subspace, the movements of a whole limb can be driven by a single oscillating unit as simple as a reflex interneuron. The output of the oscillating unit is transformed back to joint space via the same transformation. The transformation weights correspond to the dominant principal component of the movement. In this study, we propose a biologically plausible neural network to exemplify that the central nervous system (CNS) may encode our controller design. Using theoretical considerations and computer simulations, we demonstrate that spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) for the input mapping and serotonergic neuromodulation for the output mapping can extract the dominant principal component of sensory signals. Our simulations show that our network can reliably control mechanical systems of different complexity and increase the energy efficiency of ongoing cyclic movements. The proposed network is simple and consistent with previous biologic experiments. Thus, our controller could serve as a candidate to describe the neural control of fast, energy-efficient, periodic movements involving multiple coupled joints.},

The history of regression is closely related to the history of artificial neural networks since the seminal work of Rosenblatt (1958). The aims of this paper are to provide an overview of many regression algorithms, and to demonstrate how the function representation whose parameters they regress fall into two classes: a weighted sum of basis functions, or a mixture of linear models. Furthermore, we show that the former is a special case of the latter. Our ambition is thus to provide a deep understanding of the relationship between these algorithms, that, despite being derived from very different principles, use a function representation that can be captured within one unified model. Finally, step-by-step derivations of the algorithms from first principles and visualizations of their innerworkings allow this article to be used as a tutorial for those new to regression.},

The first degree of redundancy of the manipulator is used to achieve an RCM constraint, the second one is adopted for manipulability optimization. A hierarchical operational space formulation is introduced to integrate all the control components, including a Cartesian compliance control involving the main surgical task, a first null-space controller for the RCM constraint, and a second null-space controller for manipulability optimization. Experiments with virtual surgical tasks, in an augmented reality environment, were performed to validate the proposed control strategy using the KUKA LWR 4 +. The results demonstrate that end-effector accuracy and RCM constraint can be guaranteed, along with improving the manipulability of the surgical tip.},

Instead of assuming that the exact forward kinematics of the arm is given, we address the reaching problem by first learning forward kinematics with a RBFN through autonomously gathered training samples. The learnt forward model is subsequently used to construct Jacobian matrices to incrementally generate straight reaching trajectory exhibited by humans. We show that if the learning parameters are set appropriately, a RBFN trained on a small number of samples corrupted by perception noise can still lead to high reaching accuracy. The size of the training set can be further reduced without severe performance degradation if limited visual feedback is used to aid reaching after the end effector has been moved into the neighborhood of the desired object. © 2004 IEEE.},

We show that the algorithm runs much faster in practice than suggested by worst case analysis. Next, we extend the algorithm with a merging operation to obtain computationally efficient and accurate approximations with bounded error. Finally, to compute the shortest path between two given points, we use a lower-bound property of our approximate geodesic algorithm to efficiently prune the frontier of the MMP algorithm. thereby obtaining an exact solution even more quickly.},

This algorithm relies upon a representation based on projective geometry that uses a special set of polynomial functions borrowed from the field of Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD). So far, it has only been possible to learn a model of the forward kinematics function. In this paper, we show how the KBM algorithm can be modified to learn the robot's equation of motion and, hence, its inverse dynamic model. Results from experiments with a simulated serial robot manipulator are presented that clearly show the advantages of our approach compared to general function approximation methods. © 2012 IEEE.},

It can also be used for monitoring and evaluating the current robot state and support planning and decision making tasks, such as grasp selection or inverse kinematics (IK) computation. To this end, we propose an extension to the well-known Yoshikawa manipulability ellipsoid measure Yoshikawa (Int J Robotics Res 4(2):3–9, 1985), which incorporates constraining factors, such as joint limits or the self-distance between manipulator and other parts of the robot. Based on this measure we show how an extended capability representation of the robot’s workspace can be built in order to support online queries like grasp selection or inverse kinematics solving. In addition to single handed grasping tasks, we discuss how the approach can be extended to bimanual grasping tasks. The proposed approaches are evaluated in simulation and we show how the extended manipulability measure is used within the grasping and manipulation pipeline of the humanoid robot ARMAR-III.},

The creation of additional free subharmonic motions is studied by a subharmonic Melnikov analysis, and the stability of the subharmonic motions is examined by an averaging methodology. The main conclusion of this work is that the bifurcation of similar normal modes results in a class of large-scale free chaotic motions, which do not exist in the system before the bifurcation.},

  abstract = {Exploiting natural dynamics for bipedal locomotion, or passive walking, is gaining interest because of its energy efficiency. However, the natural trajectories of a passive walker are fixed during the design, thus limiting its mobility. A possible solution to this problem is creating a “semi-passive walker” equipped with actuators with adaptable compliance, which allows the natural dynamics to be changed according to the situation.This paper proposes a compliance controller, a strategy for continuously changing the compliance in such a way as to adapt the natural motion of the system to a desired trajectory. This opens up the possibility of following a range of different trajectories with a relatively low energy consumption.The idea is to fit the controllable actuator compliance to the “natural” compliance of the desired trajectory, and combine that with trajectory tracking control. This strategy was implemented and tested on a 1-DOF pendulum setup actuated by an antagonistic pair of pleated pneumatic artificial muscles. Both simulations and measurements show that the proposed strategy for choosing actuator compliance can significantly reduce the amount of control activity and energy consumption without harming tracking precision.},

The main classes are active impedance by control, inherent compliance and damping actuators, inertial actuators, and combinations of them, which are then further divided into subclasses.

A double chain structure of a CPG model is developed based on nonlinear oscillators connected with diffusive couplings. The proposed CPG model has the ability to produce stable rhythmic patterns applied both in the serpentine locomotion and sidewinding locomotion of snake robots. The global exponential stability of the model is also presented using the partial contraction theory. An important point addressed in this paper is that the proposed CPG model has explicit control parameters including not only frequencies of oscillation and amplitudes of oscillation but also phase differences between the neighbor oscillators. The method to adjust the speed and direction of the snake robot during the locomotion is discussed by modulating the control parameters in the proposed CPG model directly. Simulation results together with the experiments on a real snake robot show that the proposed CPG approach can be used to control snake robots successfully.},

An immediate practical use of the presented algorithm is its applicability to the parametric solution of underdetermined linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with coefficients that are arbitrary analytic functions in the independent variable. A second conceptual aim is to present an algorithm that is in some sense dual to the fundamental Euclids algorithm, and thus an alternative to the special case of a Gröbner basis algorithm as it is used for solving linear ODE-systems. In the paper Euclids algorithm and the new “dual version” are compared and their complementary strengths are analysed on the task of solving underdetermined ODEs. An implementation of the described algorithm is interactively accessible under [7].},

The presented DLR Floating Spring Joint (FSJ) is a VSJ module designed for the first 4 axes of the anthropomorphic DLR Hand Arm System. The DLR Hand Arm System aims to match the skills of its natural archetype. For this purpose, the joints have to be extremely compact to fit into the arm. At the same time they require a high power density in order to approximate the human arm skills. The new DLR FSJ is designed completely from an energy based point of view. This addresses not only energy efficient components and low friction design, but also that the potential energy of the spring is used as good as possible. A demonstration of robustness is given by the investigation of a blunt impact to the tip of the arm.},

In this paper, for the issue that numerical iterative method requires complex mathematical derivation and programming, and is sensitive to the initial value, a Neuro-fuzzy system is proposed for solving forward kinematics model of parallel robot. Meanwhile, inverse kinematics is used for training database, knowledge representation ability of fuzzy theory and self-learning ability of neural network are combined to overcome the shortcomings that neural network cannot express human language and fuzzy system do not have self-learning ability. In addition, training and generation efficiency of the model can also be improved by reducing the input dimension reasonably. Simulation results have been showed that, in the premise of efficiency, accuracy of forward kinematics model using Neuro-fuzzy system is better than Newton-Raphson iterative method, and has better versatility. © (2014) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.},

We describe methods for the computation of symmetry breaking bifurcations of periodic orbits for free group actions and show how bifurcations increasing the spatio-temporal symmetry of periodic orbits (including period halving bifurcations and equivariant Hopf bifurcations) can be detected and computed numerically. Our pathfollowing algorithm is based on a multiple shooting algorithm for the numerical computation of periodic orbits via an adaptive Poincaré section and a tangential continuation method with implicit reparametrization.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the benefits of using multiple gaits in a single robot. Inspired by nature, where humans and animals use different gaits to increase their energetic economy, we analyzed how increasing speed affects the choice of gait, and how the choice of gait influences optimal speed. To this end, we used optimal control as a tool to identify motions that minimize the cost of transport of two detailed models: a planar biped and a planar quadruped. Both of these models are actuated with high compliance series elastic actuators that enable a rich set of natural dynamics. These models have damping in their springs, feet with mass, and realistic limitations on actuator torques and velocities. They therefore serve as an intermediary between past simpler models and hardware. We discovered optimal motions with an established multiple shooting implementation that relies on pre-defined contact sequences, and with a direct collocation implementation in which the footfall pattern was an outcome of the optimization. Both algorithms confirmed findings from biology. For both models, changing gaits as speed varies leads to greatly increased energetic economy. For bipeds, the optimal gaits were walking at low speeds, grounded running at intermediate speeds, and running at high speeds. For quadrupeds, the optimal gaits were four-beat walking at low speeds and trotting at intermediate speeds. At high speeds, galloping and trotting were the best gaits, with nearly equal performance. We found that the transition between gaits was primarily driven by damping losses and negative actuator work, with collisions playing a relatively small role.},

  abstract = {The wheeled three-link snake model is a well-known example of an underactuated robotic system whose motion can be kinematically controlled by periodic changes of its internal shape, coupled with nonholonomic constraints. A known problem of this model is the existence of kinematic singularities at symmetric configurations where the three constraints become linearly dependent. Another critical assumption of this model is that the constraints of zero lateral slippage always hold, which requires large friction at the ground contact. This assumption breaks down when the inputs’ actuation frequency becomes too large, or when passing through singular configurations where the constraint forces grow unbounded. In this work, we extend the kinematic model by allowing for wheels slippage when the constraint forces reach an upper bound imposed by Coulomb friction. Using numerical simulations, we analyze the system’s hybrid dynamics governed by stick-slip transitions at the three wheels. We study the influence of actuation frequency on evolution of stick-slip periodic solutions which induce reversal in direction of net motion, and also show the existence of optimal frequencies that maximize the net displacement per cycle or mean translational speed. In addition, we show that passing through kinematic singularities is overcome by stick-slip transitions which keep the constraint forces and body velocity at finite bounded values. The analysis proves that in some cases, simple kinematic models of underactuated robotic locomotion should be augmented by the system’s hybrid dynamics which accounts for realistic frictional bounds on contact forces.},

The robot arm is represented by a point cloud. The structure is identified by segmenting the point cloud to subsets corresponding to different links according to a minimum matching error criterion that includes spatial continuity. The kinematic model is represented as a set of rigid transformations, which are learned by a stochastic gradient decent-based iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm. The learned transformations are then used to infer the structural relationship between segments. We validate the experiment on both synthetic data and data acquired by a Kinect depth sensor viewing a robot arm moving three of its joints. Our results demonstrate that point cloud can be correctly segmented into different rigid parts; the rigid transformations associated with each part can be learned and the kinematic structure can be correctly inferred.

  abstract   = {Few computational models have addressed the spatiotemporal features of unconstrained three-dimensional (3D) arm motion. Empirical observations made on hand paths, speed profiles, and arm postures during point-to-point movements led to the assumption that hand path and arm posture are independent of movement speed, suggesting that the geometric and temporal properties of movements are decoupled. In this study, we present a computational model of 3D movements for an arm with four degrees of freedom based on the assumption that optimization principles are separately applied at the geometric and temporal levels of control. Geometric properties (path and posture) are defined in terms of geodesic paths with respect to the kinetic energy metric in the Riemannian configuration space. Accordingly, a geodesic path can be generated with less muscular effort than on any other, nongeodesic path, because the sum of all configuration-speed-dependent torques vanishes. The temporal properties of the movement (speed) are determined in task space by minimizing the squared jerk along the selected end-effector path. The integration of both planning levels into a single spatiotemporal representation simplifies the control of arm dynamics along geodesic paths and results in movements with near minimal torque change and minimal peak value of kinetic energy. Thus, the application of Riemannian geometry allows for a reconciliation of computational models previously proposed for the description of arm movements. We suggest that geodesics are an emergent property of the motor system through the exploration of dynamical space. Our data validated the predictions for joint trajectories, hand paths, final postures, speed profiles, and driving torques.},
