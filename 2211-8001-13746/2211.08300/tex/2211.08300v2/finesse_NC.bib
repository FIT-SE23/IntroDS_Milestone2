title = {Optical properties and the photoluminescence quantum yield
of organic molecular materials},
journal = {Journal of Optics A: Pure and Applied Optics},
abstract = {Dealing with synthetic molecules the connection with optical design in Nature resides in the way the self-ordering of molecules affects the optical properties of condensed matter. In this paper we show the different nature of optical properties as a function of the specific molecular packing in crystalline samples and vacuum sublimed films. On the other hand, investigating the optical behaviour of synthetic molecular ensembles can shed light on the understanding of natural optical designs as, conversely, the optical design in nature can help in the fabrication of molecular architectures with specific optical characteristics. The optical properties of organic conjugated materials are determined by the effective intermolecular interactions in the solid and are, therefore, highly dependent on the specific molecular packing. We show that in the model system of α-sexithienyl (T6) the origin of fluorescence is excitonic in molecularly ordered single crystals, while it is due to molecular aggregates in the case of polycrystalline thin films. Molecular aggregates are due to a modified local molecular packing, which can be induced and controlled by acting on the sublimation conditions during the film growth. The energy transport and photoluminescence quantum yield in vacuum sublimed thin films of T6 are investigated as a function of temperature in the range 30-300 K. The photoluminescence absolute quantum yield of intrinsic bulk excitons and molecular aggregate states is measured with a home-built experimental apparatus based on an integrating sphere, which allows photoluminescence quantum yield and electroluminescence quantum yield measurements in the temperature range 5-400 K. The photoluminescence quantum yield of the molecular aggregates placed below the exciton band spans from 0.1 to 5% in the temperature range 300-30 K. In the same temperature range, the quantum efficiency of the intrinsic excitons increases by a factor of two from 0.4 to 1%. Therefore, in organic thin films both the optical emission spectral properties and quantum yield depend on the relative concentration of molecular aggregates formed during the growth process.}

title = {Synchronization of interacting quantum dipoles},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {Macroscopic ensembles of radiating dipoles are ubiquitous in the physical and natural sciences. In the classical limit the dipoles can be described as damped-driven oscillators, which are able to spontaneously synchronize and collectively lock their phases in the presence of nonlinear coupling. Here we investigate the corresponding phenomenon with arrays of quantized two-level systems coupled via long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions. Our calculations demonstrate that by incoherently driving dense packed arrays of strongly interacting dipoles, the dipoles can overcome the decoherence induced by quantum fluctuations and inhomogeneous coupling and reach a synchronized steady-state characterized by a macroscopic phase coherence. This steady-state bears much similarity to that observed in classical systems, and yet also exhibits genuine quantum properties such as quantum correlations and quantum phase diffusion (reminiscent of lasing). Our predictions could be relevant for the development of better atomic clocks and a variety of noise tolerant quantum devices.}

abstract = {Abstract Strong coupling of molecules placed in an optical microcavity may lead to the formation of hybrid states called polaritons, states that inherit characteristics of both the optical cavity modes and the molecular resonance. This is possible for both excitonic and vibrational molecular resonances. Previous work has shown that strong coupling may be used to hybridize two different excitonic resonances; this can be achieved when more than one molecular species is included in the cavity. Here it is shown that under suitable conditions three different molecular vibrational resonances of the same molecular unit may also be coupled together, the resulting polariton having characteristics of all three vibrational resonances. These results suggest that strong coupling might be used to manipulate vibrational resonances in a richer and subtler way than previously considered, opening a path to greater control of molecular systems and molecular processes via vibrational strong coupling.},

abstract={Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) systems allow the study of a variety of fundamental quantum-optics phenomena, such as entanglement, quantum decoherence and the quantum--classical boundary1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Such systems also provide test beds for quantum information science. Nearly all strongly coupled cavity QED experiments have used a single atom in a high-quality-factor (high-Q) cavity. Here we report the experimental realization of a strongly coupled system in the solid state: a single quantum dot embedded in the spacer of a nanocavity, showing vacuum-field Rabi splitting exceeding the decoherence linewidths of both the nanocavity and the quantum dot. This requires a small-volume cavity and an atomic-like two-level system5,10. The photonic crystal11 slab nanocavity---which traps photons when a defect is introduced inside the two-dimensional photonic bandgap by leaving out one or more holes12---has both high Q and small modal volume V, as required for strong light--matter interactions13. The quantum dot has two discrete energy levels with a transition dipole moment much larger than that of an atom14,15,16, and it is fixed in the nanocavity during growth.},

Among the most promising systems for these studies are semiconductor quantum dots inside photonic crystal, micropillar or microdisk resonators. We review the progress so far in obtaining true quantum-optical strong-coupling effects in semiconductors. We discuss the recent results on vacuum Rabi splitting with a single quantum dot, emphasizing the differences from quantum-well systems. Finally, we propose nonlinear tests for the true quantum limit and speculate about applications in quantum information devices.},

abstract = {Abstract Key in the application of plasmonics is the realization of low loss or high quality (Q) factor resonances. Nanoparticle arrays are systems capable of sustaining remarkably high Q-factor resonances through the hybridization of plasmonic and photonic modes, known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). SLRs result from the coupling of localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) to in-plane orders of diffraction known as Rayleigh anomalies (RAs). To date, the highest Q-factors have been achieved with the (±1, 0) diffraction orders. However, these Q-factors are highly sensitive to the angle of excitation. Here, a strategy is presented to generate high Q-factor SLRs with low dispersion by coupling LSPRs to the (0, ±1) diffraction orders. 2D arrays of silver nanoparticles are investigated experimentally and numerically, and it is shown that the Q-factor of SLRs critically depends on the quality of the metal film, the detuning between RAs and LSPRs, and the absorption of adhesive layer used between the substrate and the metallic nanoparticles. These silver nanoparticle arrays can achieve Q-factors higher than 330 in the visible range. These extraordinarily high Q-factors could be increased to values above 1500 if no adhesive layer is used, which could significantly improve sensors and enhance nonlinearities in plasmonic systems.},
