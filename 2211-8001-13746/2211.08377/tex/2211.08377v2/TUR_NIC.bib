@article{Kiran2021,
	abstract = {We study the optimal performance of a three-level quantum refrigerator using a trade-off objective function, Ω function, which represents a compromise between the energy benefits and the energy losses of a thermal device. First, we optimize the performance of our refrigerator by employing a two-parameter optimization scheme and show that the first two terms in the series expansion of the obtained coefficient of performance (COP) match with those of some classical models of the refrigerator. Then, in the high-temperature limit, optimizing with respect to one parameter while constraining the other one, we obtain the lower and upper bounds on the COP for both strong as well as weak (intermediate) matter-field coupling conditions. In the strong matter-field coupling regime, the obtained bounds on the COP exactly match with the bounds already known for some models of classical refrigerators. Further, for weak matter-field coupling, we derive some new bounds on the COP of the refrigerator, which lie beyond the range covered by bounds obtained for strong matter-field coupling. Then, in the parameter regime where both cooling power and Ω function can be maximized, we compare the cooling power of the quantum refrigerator at maximum Ω function with the maximum cooling power. Finally, in addition to carrying optimization over the internal parameters (frequencies) of the three-level system, we optimize the performance of the three-level model with respect to system-bath coupling parameters and highlight its implications on the performance of both engine and refrigerator modes of operation.},

@article{Menczel2021,
	abstract = {In classical Markov jump processes, current fluctuations can only be reduced at the cost of increased dissipation. To explore how quantum effects influence this trade-off, we analyze the uncertainty of steady-state currents in Markovian open quantum systems. We first consider three instructive examples and then systematically minimize the product of uncertainty and entropy production for small open quantum systems. As our main result, we find that the thermodynamic cost of reducing fluctuations can be lowered below the classical bound by coherence. We conjecture that this cost can be made arbitrarily small in quantum systems with sufficiently many degrees of freedom. Our results thereby provide a general guideline for the design of thermal machines in the quantum regime that operate with high thermodynamic precision, meaning low dissipation and small fluctuations around average values.},

@article{Barato_2018,
	abstract = {Small nonequilibrium systems in contact with a heat bath can be analyzed with the framework of stochastic thermodynamics. In such systems, fluctuations, which are not negligible, follow universal relations such as the fluctuation theorem. More recently, it has been found that, for nonequilibrium stationary states, the full spectrum of fluctuations of any thermodynamic current is bounded by the average rate of entropy production and the average current. However, this bound does not apply to periodically driven systems, such as heat engines driven by periodic variation of the temperature and artificial molecular pumps driven by an external protocol. We obtain a universal bound on current fluctuations for periodically driven systems. This bound is a generalization of the known bound for stationary states. In general, the average rate that bounds fluctuations in periodically driven systems is different from the rate of entropy production. We also obtain a local bound on fluctuations that leads to a trade-off relation between speed and precision in periodically driven systems, which constitutes a generalization to periodically driven systems of the so called thermodynamic uncertainty relation. From a technical perspective, our results are obtained with the use of a recently developed theory for 2.5 large deviations for Markov jump processes with time-periodic transition rates.},

@article{Dechant_2018,
	abstract = {We derive a universal bound on generalized currents in Langevin systems in terms of the mean-square fluctuations of the current and the total entropy production. This bound generalizes a relation previously found by Barato et al to arbitrary times and transient states. Using the bound, we define a new efficiency for stochastic transport, which measures how close a given system comes to saturating the bound. The existence of such a bounded efficiency implies that stochastic transport is unavoidably accompanied by a fluctuations and dissipation, which cannot be reduced arbitrarily. We apply the definition of transport efficiency to steady state particle transport and heat engines and show that the transport efficiency may approach unity at finite current, in contrast to the thermodynamic efficiency. Finally, we derive a bound on purely diffusive transport in terms of the Shannon entropy.},

	annote = {Heat exchanges are the essence of Thermodynamics. In order to investigate non-equilibrium effects like quantum coherence and correlations in heat flows we introduce the concept of apparent temperature. Its definition is based on the expression of the heat flow between out-of-equilibrium quantum systems. Such apparent temperatures contain crucial information on the role and impact of correlations and coherence in heat exchanges. In particular, both behave as populations, affecting dramatically the population balance and therefore the apparent temperatures and the heat flows. We show how seminal results can be re-obtained, offering an interesting alternative point of view. We also present new predictions and suggest a simple experiment to test them. Our results show how quantum and non-equilibrium effects can be used advantageously, finding applications in quantum thermal machine designs and non-equilibrium thermodynamics but also in collective-effect phenomena.},

The optimal relations between the rate of exergy output and the coefficient of performance and between the rate of exergy output and the rate of refrigeration are derived. Moreover, the main characteristics of the two optimal relations are discussed and some uses of the concept of exergy in finite-time thermodynamic theory are expounded. Some novel and useful results are obtained. Finally, it is pointed out that to extend the traditional exergy analysis using the theory of finite-time thermodynamics is quite important.},

@article{DiSalvo1999,
	abstract = {In a typical thermoelectric device, a junction is formed from two different conducting materials, one containing positive charge carriers (holes) and the other negative charge carriers (electrons). When an electric current is passed in the appropriate direction through the junction, both types of charge carriers move away from the junction and convey heat away, thus cooling the junction. Similarly, a heat source at the junction causes carriers to flow away from the junction, making an electrical generator. Such devices have the advantage of containing no moving parts, but low efficiencies have limited their use to specialty applications, such as cooling laser diodes. The principles of thermoelectric devices are reviewed and strategies for increasing the efficiency of novel materials are explored. Improved materials would not only help to cool advanced electronics but could also provide energy benefits in refrigeration and when using waste heat to generate electrical power.},

@article{Goupil2011,
	abstract = {Fifty years ago, the optimization of thermoelectric devices was analyzed by considering the relation between optimal performances and local entropy production. Entropy is produced by the irreversible processes in thermoelectric devices. If these processes could be eliminated, entropy production would be reduced to zero, and the limiting Carnot efficiency or coefficient of performance would be obtained. In the present review, we start with some fundamental thermodynamic considerations relevant for thermoelectrics. Based on a historical overview, we reconsider the interrelation between optimal performances and local entropy production by using the compatibility approach together with the thermodynamic arguments. Using the relative current density and the thermoelectric potential, we show that minimum entropy production can be obtained when the thermoelectric potential is a specific, optimal value.},

The efficiencies at maximum power of normal-, sub- and super-dissipative Carnot-like heat engines are proved to be bounded between η C /2 and η C /(2 − η C ), η C /2 and η C , 0 and η C /(2 − η C ), respectively. These bounds are also shared by linear, sub- and super-linear irreversible Carnot-like engines [Tu and Wang, Europhys.

The analytical results of efficiency at maximum power for the Curzon---Ahlborn heat engine, the stochastic heat engine constructed from a Brownian particle, and Feynman's ratchet as a heat engine are presented. It is found that: the efficiency at maximum power exhibits universal behavior at small relative temperature differences; the lower and the upper bounds might exist under quite general conditions; and the problem of efficiency at maximum power comes down to seeking for the minimum irreversible entropy production in each finite-time isothermal process for a given time.},

We calculate their efficiency at maximum power output for two simple generic models and show that the qualitative behaviour depends crucially on the position of the transition state or, equivalently, on the load distribution factor. Specifically, we find a transition state near the initial state (sometimes characterized as a "power stroke") to be most favorable with respect to both high power output and high efficiency at maximum power. In this regime, driving the motor further out of equilibrium by applying higher chemical potential differences can even, counterintuitively, increase the efficiency.},

Our main message is that both electrical and thermal impedance matching conditions must be met for optimal device performance. Our analysis is fundamentally based on linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics using the force-flux formalism. An outlook on mesoscopic systems is also given.},

The resulting nanoscale system yields asymmetric axial thermal conductance with greater heat flow in the direction of decreasing mass density. The effect cannot be explained by ordinary perturbative wave theories, and instead we suggest that solitons may be responsible for the phenomenon.

@article{Josefsson2018,
	abstract = {Cyclical heat engines are a paradigm of classical thermodynamics, but are impractical for miniaturization because they rely on moving parts. A more recent concept is particle-exchange (PE) heat engines, which uses energy filtering to control a thermally driven particle flow between two heat reservoirs1,2. As they do not require moving parts and can be realized in solid-state materials, they are suitable for low-power applications and miniaturization. It was predicted that PE engines could reach the same thermodynamically ideal efficiency limits as those accessible to cyclical engines3-6, but this prediction has not been verified experimentally. Here, we demonstrate a PE heat engine based on a quantum dot (QD) embedded into a semiconductor nanowire. We directly measure the engine's steady-state electric power output and combine it with the calculated electronic heat flow to determine the electronic efficiency e. We find that at the maximum power conditions, e is in agreement with the Curzon-Ahlborn efficiency6-9 and that the overall maximum e is in excess of 70\% of the Carnot efficiency while maintaining a finite power output. Our results demonstrate that thermoelectric power conversion can, in principle, be achieved close to the thermodynamic limits, with direct relevance for future hot-carrier photovoltaics10, on-chip coolers or energy harvesters for quantum technologies.},
