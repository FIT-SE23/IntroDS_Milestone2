    abstract = "{Predicting structural properties of dark matter haloes is one of the fundamental goals of modern cosmology. We use the suite of MultiDark cosmological simulations to study the evolution of dark matter halo density profiles, concentrations, and velocity anisotropies. We find that in order to understand the structure of dark matter haloes and to make 1–2 per cent accurate predictions for density profiles, one needs to realize that halo concentration is more complex than the ratio of the virial radius to the core radius in the Navarro–Frenk–White (NFW) profile. For massive haloes, the average density profile is far from the NFW shape and the concentration is defined by both the core radius and the shape parameter α in the Einasto approximation. We show that haloes progress through three stages of evolution. They start as rare density peaks and experience fast and nearly radial infall that brings mass closer to the centre, producing a highly concentrated halo. Here, the halo concentration increases with increasing halo mass and the concentration is defined by the α parameter with a nearly constant core radius. Later haloes slide into the plateau regime where the accretion becomes less radial, but frequent mergers still affect even the central region. At this stage, the concentration does not depend on halo mass. Once the rate of accretion and merging slows down, haloes move into the domain of declining concentration–mass relation because new accretion piles up mass close to the virial radius while the core radius is staying constant. Accurate analytical fits are provided.}",

    abstract = "{We present the MAssive ClusterS and Intercluster Structures (MACSIS) project, a suite of 390 clusters simulated with baryonic physics that yields realistic massive galaxy clusters capable of matching a wide range of observed properties. MACSIS extends the recent BAryons and HAloes of MAssive Systems simulation to higher masses, enabling robust predictions for the redshift evolution of cluster properties and an assessment of the effect of selecting only the hottest systems. We study the observable–mass scaling relations and the X-ray luminosity–temperature relation over the complete observed cluster mass range. As expected, we find that the slope of these scaling relations and the evolution of their normalization with redshift depart significantly from the self-similar predictions. However, for a sample of hot clusters with core-excised temperatures kBT ≥ 5 keV, the normalization and the slope of the observable–mass relations and their evolution are significantly closer to self-similar. The exception is the temperature–mass relation, for which the increased importance of non-thermal pressure support and biased X-ray temperatures leads to a greater departure from self-similarity in the hottest systems. As a consequence, these also affect the slope and evolution of the normalization in the luminosity–temperature relation. The median hot gas profiles show good agreement with observational data at z = 0 and z = 1, with their evolution again departing significantly from the self-similar prediction. However, selecting a hot sample of clusters yields profiles that evolve significantly closer to the self-similar prediction. In conclusion, our results show that understanding the selection function is vital for robust calibration of cluster properties with mass and redshift.}",

	abstract = {We present results obtained from a set of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy clusters, aimed at comparing predictions with observational data on the diversity between cool-core (CC) and non-cool-core (NCC) clusters. Our simulations include the effects of stellar and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback and are based on an improved version of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code GADGET-3, which ameliorates gas mixing and better captures gas-dynamical instabilities by including a suitable artificial thermal diffusion. In this Letter, we focus our analysis on the entropy profiles, the primary diagnostic we used to classify the degree of cool-coreness of clusters, and the iron profiles. In keeping with observations, our simulated clusters display a variety of behaviors in entropy profiles: they range from steadily decreasing profiles at small radii, characteristic of CC systems, to nearly flat core isentropic profiles, characteristic of NCC systems. Using observational criteria to distinguish between the two classes of objects, we find that they occur in similar proportions in both simulations and observations. Furthermore, we also find that simulated CC clusters have profiles of iron abundance that are steeper than those of NCC clusters, which is also in agreement with observational results. We show that the capability of our simulations to generate a realistic CC structure in the cluster population is due to AGN feedback and artificial thermal diffusion: their combined action allows us to naturally distribute the energy extracted from super-massive black holes and to compensate for the radiative losses of low-entropy gas with short cooling time residing in the cluster core.}

    abstract = "{We introduce the Marenostrum-MultiDark SImulations of galaxy Clusters (MUSIC) data set. It constitutes one of the largest samples of hydrodynamically simulated galaxy clusters with more than 500 clusters and 2000 groups. The objects have been selected from two large N-body simulations and have been resimulated at high resolution using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) together with relevant physical processes that include cooling, UV photoionization, star formation and different feedback processes associated with supernovae explosions.In this first paper we focus on the analysis of the baryon content (gas and star) of clusters in the MUSIC data set as a function of both aperture radius and redshift. The results from our simulations are compared with a compilation of the most recent observational estimates of the gas fraction in galaxy clusters at different overdensity radii. We confirm, as in previous simulations, that the gas fraction is overestimated if radiative physics are not properly taken into account. On the other hand, when the effects of cooling and stellar feedbacks are included, the MUSIC clusters show a good agreement with the most recent observed gas fractions quoted in the literature. A clear dependence of the gas fractions with the total cluster mass is also evident. However, we do not find a significant evolution with redshift of the gas fractions at aperture radius corresponding to overdensities smaller than 1500 with respect to critical density. At smaller radii, the gas fraction does exhibit a decrease with redshift that is related to the gas depletion due to star formation in the central region of the clusters. The impact of the aperture radius choice, when comparing integrated quantities at different redshifts, is tested. The standard, widely used definition of radius at a fixed overdensity with respect to critical density is compared with a definition of aperture radius based on the redshift dependent overdensity with respect to background matter density: we show that the latter definition is more successful in probing the same fraction of the virial radius at different redshifts, providing a more reliable derivation of the time evolution of integrated quantities. We also present in this paper a detailed analysis of the scaling relations of the thermal Sunyaev–Zel'dovich (SZ) effect derived from MUSIC clusters. The integrated SZ brightness, Y, is related to the cluster total mass, M, as well as, the M − Y counterpart which is more suitable for observational applications. Both laws are consistent with predictions from the self-similar model, showing a very low scatter which is σlog Y ≃ 0.04 and even a smaller one (σlog M ≃ 0.03) for the inverse M–Y relation. The effects of the gas fraction on the Y–M scaling relation are also studied. At high overdensities, the dispersion of the gas fractions introduces non-negligible deviation from self-similarity, which is directly related to the fgas–M relation. The presence of a possible redshift dependence on the Y–M scaling relation is also explored. No significant evolution of the SZ relations is found at lower overdensities, regardless of the definition of overdensity used.}",

However, simba also yields an insufficiently sharp truncation of the z = 0 mass function, and too-large sizes for low-mass quenched galaxies. We show that simba’s jet feedback is primarily responsible for quenching massive galaxies.}",

The cluster zooms were simulated using the same cosmological models as the BAHAMAS and C-EAGLE projects, leading to differences in both the hydrodynamics solvers and the subgrid physics but still producing clusters that broadly match observations. At the same mass resolution as BAHAMAS, for the most massive clusters (M500 \\&gt; 1015 M⊙), we find that changes in the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method produce the greatest differences in the final halo, while the subgrid models dominate at lower mass. By calculating the mass of all of the clusters using different permutations of the pressure, temperature, and density profiles, created with either the true simulated data or mock spectroscopic data, we find that the spectroscopic temperature causes a bias in the hydrostatic mass estimates that increases with the mass of the cluster, regardless of the SPH flavour used. For the most massive clusters, the estimated mass of the cluster using spectroscopic density and temperature profiles is found to be as low as 50 per cent of the true mass compared to ∼90 per cent for low-mass clusters. When including a correction for non-thermal pressure, the spectroscopic hydrostatic mass estimates are less biased on average and the mass dependence of the bias is reduced, although the scatter in the measurements does increase.}",

    abstract = "{Clusters of galaxies are useful tools to constrain cosmological parameters, only if their masses can be correctly inferred from observations. In particular, X-ray and Sunyaev–Zeldovich (SZ) effect observations can be used to derive masses within the framework of the hydrostatic equilibrium. Therefore, it is crucial to have a good control of the possible mass biases that can be introduced when this hypothesis is not valid. In this work, we analysed a set of 260 synthetic clusters from the MUSIC simulation project at redshifts 0 ≤ z ≤ 0.82. We estimate the hydrostatic mass of the MUSIC clusters from X-ray only (temperature and density) and from X-ray and SZ (density and pressure). Then, we compare them with the true 3D dynamical mass. The biases are of the order of 20 per cent. We find that using the temperature instead of the pressure leads to a smaller bias, although the two values are compatible within 1σ. Non-thermal contributions to the total pressure support, arising from bulk motion and turbulence of the gas, are also computed and show that they are sufficient to account for this bias. We also present a study of the correlation between the mass bias and the dynamical state of the clusters. A clear correlation is shown between the relaxation state of the clusters and the bias factor. We applied the same analysis on a subsample of 32 objects, already selected for supporting the NIKA2 SZ Large Program.}",

We quantify cluster dynamical state using a combination of dynamical indicators from theoretical measures and compare this combined parameter, χ, with the results from morphological classifications. The dynamical state of the cluster sample shows a continuous distribution from dynamically relaxed, more abundant at lower redshift, to hybrid and disturbed. The dynamical state presents a clear dependence on the radius, with internal regions more relaxed than outskirts. The morphology from multiwavelength mock observation of clusters in X-ray, optical, and Sunyaev–Zel’dovich (SZ) effect images is quantified by M – a combination of six parameters for X-ray and SZ maps and the offsets between the optical position of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the X-ray/SZ centroids. All the morphological parameters are highly correlated with each other, while they show a moderately strong correlation with the dynamical χ parameter. The X-ray or SZ peaks are less affected by the dynamical state than centroids, which results in reliable tracers of the cluster density peak. The principal source of contamination in the relaxed cluster fraction, inferred from morphological parameters, is due to dynamically hybrid clusters. Compared to individual parameters, which consider only one aspect of cluster property (e.g. only clumping or asymmetry), the combined morphological and dynamical parameters (M and χ) collect more information and provide a single and more accurate estimation of the cluster dynamical state.}",

In this work, we provide scaling relations for the shapes of dark matter haloes as a function of mass (peak height) and redshift over more than four orders of magnitude in halo masses, namely from 1011.5 to 1015.8 h−1 M⊙. We have analysed four dark matter only simulations from the MultiDark cosmological simulation suite with more than 56 billion particles within boxes of 4.0, 2.5, 1.0 and 0.4 h−1 Gpc size assuming Planck cosmology. The dark matter haloes have been identified in the simulations using the rockstar halo finder, which also determines the axis ratios in terms of the diagonalization of the inertia tensor. In order to infer the shape for a hypothetical halo of a given mass at a given redshift, we provide fitting functions to the minor-to-major and intermediate-to-major axis ratios as a function of the peak height.}",

    abstract = "{Surveys in the next decade will deliver large samples of galaxy clusters that transform our understanding of their formation. Cluster astrophysics and cosmology studies will become systematics limited with samples of this magnitude. With known properties, hydrodynamical simulations of clusters provide a vital resource for investigating potential systematics. However, this is only realized if we compare simulations to observations in the correct way. Here we introduce the Mock-X analysis framework, a multiwavelength tool that generates synthetic images from cosmological simulations and derives halo properties via observational methods. We detail our methods for generating optical, Compton-y and X-ray images. Outlining our synthetic X-ray image analysis method, we demonstrate the capabilities of the framework by exploring hydrostatic mass bias for the IllustrisTNG, BAHAMAS and MACSIS simulations. Using simulation derived profiles we find an approximately constant bias b ≈ 0.13 with cluster mass, independent of hydrodynamical method or subgrid physics. However, the hydrostatic bias derived from synthetic observations is mass-dependent, increasing to b = 0.3 for the most massive clusters. This result is driven by a single temperature fit to a spectrum produced by gas with a wide temperature distribution in quasi-pressure equilibrium. The spectroscopic temperature and mass estimate are biased low by cooler gas dominating the emission, due to its quadratic density dependence. The bias and the scatter in estimated mass remain independent of the numerical method and subgrid physics. Our results are consistent with current observations and future surveys will contain sufficient samples of massive clusters to confirm the mass dependence of the hydrostatic bias.}",

	journal = {ApJ},
	abstract = {In the past 15 years, the concentration–mass relation has been investigated diffusely in theoretical studies. On the other hand, only recently has this relation been derived from X-ray observations. When that happened, the results caused a certain level of concern: the X-ray normalizations and slopes were found significantly dissimilar from those predicted by theory. We analyzed 52 galaxy clusters and groups, simulated with different descriptions of the physical processes that affect the baryonic component, with the purpose of determining whether these discrepancies are real or induced by biases in the computation of the concentration parameter or in the determination of the selection function of the cluster sample for which the analysis is carried out. In particular, we investigate how the simulated concentration–mass relation depends (1) on the radial range used to derive the concentration; (2) on the presence of baryons in the simulations, and on the effect of star formation and feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Finally, we evaluate (3) how the results differ when adopting an X-ray approach for the analysis and (4) how the selection function based on X-ray luminosity can impact the results. All effects studied go in the direction of alleviating the discrepancy between observations and simulations, although with different significance: while the choice of the radial range to fit the profiles and the inclusion of the baryonic component play only a minor role, the X-ray approach to reconstruct the mass profiles and the selection of the cluster sample have a strong impact on the resulting concentration–mass relation. Extending the fit to the most central regions or reducing the fitting radius from the virial boundary to the typical X-ray external radius causes an increase of the normalization in radiative simulations by 5%–10%. In the second case, we measure a slope that is up to twice steeper than that derived by using the typical theoretical radial range. Radiative simulations including only supernova feedback produce 30% higher concentrations than the dark matter case. Such a difference is largely reduced when including the effect of AGN feedback. The concentration–mass relation derived from the X-ray synthetic catalog is significantly steeper due to the combination of several different effects, such as environment, dynamical state and dynamical history of the clusters, bias in mass and temperature measurements, and their dependence on the radius and on the mass of the system. Finally, selecting clusters according to their X-ray luminosity produces a net increase in both normalization and slope of the relation, since at fixed mass, the most luminous clusters are also the most concentrated.}

    abstract = "{We report on the analysis of a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations (incorporating cooling and star formation) of mergers involving idealized X-ray clusters whose initial conditions resemble relaxed clusters with cool compact cores observed by Chandra and XMM. The simulations sample the most-interesting, theoretically plausible, range of impact parameters and progenitor mass ratios. We find that all mergers evolve via a common progression. We illustrate this progression in the projected gas density, X-ray surface brightness, Sunyaev–Zel'dovich, temperature, and gas-entropy maps. Several different classes of transient ‘cold front’ like features can arise over the course of a merger. Each class is distinguished by a distinct morphological signature and physical cause. We find that all these classes are present in Chandra and XMM observations of merging systems and propose a naming scheme for these features: ‘comet-like’ tails, bridges, plumes, streams and edges. In none of the cases considered do the initial cool compact cores of the primary and the secondary get destroyed during the course of the mergers. Instead, the two remnant cores eventually combine to form a new core that, depending on the final mass of the remnant, can have a greater cooling efficiency than either of its progenitors. We quantify the evolving morphology of our mergers using centroid variance, power ratios and offset between the X-ray and the projected mass maps. We find that the centroid variance best captures the dynamical state of the cluster. It also provides an excellent indicator of how far the system is from virial and hydrostatic equilibrium. Placing the system at z= 0.1, we find that all easily identified observable traces of the secondary disappear from a simulated 50-ks Chandra image following the second pericentric passage. The system, however, takes an additional ∼2 Gyr to relax and virialize. Observationally, the only reliable indicator of a system in this state is the smoothness of its X-ray surface brightness isophotes, not temperature fluctuations. Temperature fluctuations at the level of ΔT/T∼ 20 per cent, can persist in the final systems well past the point of virialization, suggesting that the existence of temperature fluctuations, in and of themselves, does not necessarily indicate a disturbed or unrelaxed system.}",
