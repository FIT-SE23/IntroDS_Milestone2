        Sensitivity analyses
        of the temperature coefficient \( \tau \)
        as introduced in~\eqref{eq:weight}
        and used in \( \attackloss \).
        All ensembles use softmax values
        of sub-models to form outputs,
        as this is used by
        ADP~\cite{pang2019adp}, GAL~\cite{kariyappa2019gal}
        and Dverge~\cite{yang2020dverge}.
        All defending ensembles share similar flat regions
        of optimal \( \tau \) with low sensitivity.
