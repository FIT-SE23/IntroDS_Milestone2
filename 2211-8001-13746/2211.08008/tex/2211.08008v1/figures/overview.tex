        A high-level overview of \attack.
        Existing attack methods
        focus on maximizing the \( \sceloss \)
        of the ensemble predictions \( \logit\E \).
        \attack{} further
        introduces a model-reweighing mechanism,
        which takes as input
        sub-models predictions
        \( {\logit{1:M}} \),
        and the ensemble output \( \logit\E \),
        forming a combined loss \( \attackloss \).
        \attack{} generates adversarial examples
        by maximizing the resulting loss.
