We briefly explain the algebraic background relevant for the definition of the the main character of this paper: the element $A \in \HF(\tau^{-1})$.
We follow the conventions for $A_{\infty}$-machinery from \cite{seidelbook}.

Suppose $\mathcal{A}$ is a homologically unital $A_\infty$-category. The Yoneda embedding is a functor
\[
\mathcal{Y} \colon \mathcal{A} \rightarrow mod_{\mathcal{A}}
\]
taking an object $L$ to the $\mathcal{A}$-module 
$\mathcal{Y}(L)$
defined by
\[
\mathcal{Y}(L)(K) := Mor_{\mathcal{A}}(K,L).
\]
and 
\[
\mu^d_{\mathcal{Y}(L)}(b,a_{d-1}, \dots, a_1) := \mu^d(b, a_{d-1}, \dots , a_1)
\]
for $a_i \in Mor_{\mathcal{A}}(K_{i-1},K_i)$, $i\in \{1, \dots , d-1\}$ 
and $b \in \mathcal{Y}(L)(K_{d-1}) = Mor_{\mathcal{A}}(K_{d-1},L)$.

By \cite[Section 2g]{seidelbook} the Yoneda embedding induces a unital, full and faithfull embedding
\[
\Homol(\mathcal{Y}) \colon \Homol(\mathcal{A}) \to \Homol(mod_{\mathcal{A}}).
\]
The derived cateogory $\mathcal{DA}$ of $\mathcal{A}$
can be constructed as follows: Take a triangulated completion of the image of $\mathcal{Y}$ in $mod_{\mathcal{A}}$ and take its homology category.

The following is an immediate consequence of the properties of the Yoneda embedding. 

\begin{cor}
 Each $f\in Mor_{D\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{Y}(L_1), \mathcal{Y}(L_2))$ can be represented by 
 $\mathcal{Y}(\alpha)$
 for some $\alpha \in Mor_{\mathcal{A}}(L_1,L_2)$. 
 Moreover, $[\alpha]\in Mor_{H(\mathcal{A})}(L_1,L_2)$ is uniquely defined. 
 \end{cor}
 \begin{proof}
First, note that
\[
Mor_{D\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{Y}(L_1), \mathcal{Y}(L_2))
\cong \Homol(Mor_{mod_{\mathcal{A}}}(\mathcal{Y}(L_1), \mathcal{Y}(L_2))).
\]
 For any object $K$, $\mathcal{Y}(\alpha)$ determines the map
 \[
 \mathcal{Y}(L_1)(K) \cong Mor(K,L_1) \xrightarrow{\mu^2(\alpha,-)}  
 Mor(K,L_2) \cong \mathcal{Y}(L_2)
 \]
 The existence and uniqueness of $\alpha$ follow immediately from $\Homol(\mathcal{Y})$ being full and faithful.
\end{proof}

\noindent
These notions are applied in this paper to the $A_{\infty}$-category $\mathcal{F}uk(M)$.

\subsection{$A_\infty$-categories}
We work in a homological setting, in contrast to Seidel's book.
Moreover, we work in an ungraded setting, maybe later updated to a $\Z / 2\Z$-grading.

We briefly recall here the main definitions and fix notation.

Suppose $\mathcal{A}$ is a homologically unital $A_\infty$-category. The Yoneda embedding is a functor
\[
\mathcal{Y} \colon \mathcal{A} \rightarrow mod_{\mathcal{A}}
\]
taking an object $L$ to the $\mathcal{A}$-module 
$\mathcal{Y}(L)$
defined by
\[
\mathcal{Y}(L)(K) := Mor_{\mathcal{A}}(K,L).
\]
and 
\[
\mu^{\mathcal{Y}(L)}(a_1, \dots, a_{n-1},b) := \mu_n(a_1, \dots , a_{n-1},b)
\]
for $a_i \in Mor_{\mathcal{A}}(K_i,K_{i+1})$, $i\in \{1, \dots , n-1\}$ 
and $b \in \mathcal{Y}(L)(K_n) = Mor_{\mathcal{A}}(K_n,L)$.

By Seidel, section 2g, the Yoneda embedding induces a unital, full and faithfull embedding
\[
H(\mathcal{Y}) \colon H(\mathcal{A}) \to H(mod_{\mathcal{A}}).
\]

The derived cateogory $\mathcal{DA}$ of $\mathcal{A}$
can be constructed as follows: Take a triangulated completion of $mod_{\mathcal{A}}$ and take its homology category.

The following is an immediate consequence of the properties of the Yoneda embedding. We include it here, since it is relevant for this article.

\begin{cor}
 Each $f\in Mor_{D\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{Y}(L_2), \mathcal{Y}(L_1))$ can be represented by 
 $\mathcal{Y}(\alpha)$
 for some $\alpha \in Mor_{\mathcal{A}}(L_2,L_1)$. 
 Moreover, $[\alpha]\in Mor_{H(\mathcal{A})}(L_2,L_1)$ is uniquely defined. 
 For any object $K$, $\mathcal{Y}(\alpha)$ determines the map
 \[
 \mathcal{Y}(L_2)(K) \cong Mor(K,L_2) \xrightarrow{\mu_2(-,\alpha)}  
 Mor(K,L_1) \cong \mathcal{Y}(L_1)
 \]
 
\end{cor}
\begin{proof}
First, note that
\[
Mor_{D\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{Y}(L_2), \mathcal{Y}(L_1))
\cong H(Mor_{mod_{\mathcal{A}}}(\mathcal{Y}(L_2), \mathcal{Y}(L_1))).
\]


First, note that
\[
Mor_{D\mathcal{A}}(\mathcal{Y}(L_2), \mathcal{Y}(L_1))
\cong H(Mor_{mod_{\mathcal{A}}}(\mathcal{Y}(L_2), \mathcal{Y}(L_1))) \cong Mor_{H({\mathcal{A}})}(\mathcal{Y}_H(L_2), \mathcal{Y}_H(L_1)),
\]
where $\mathcal{Y}_H(L) = H(Mor_\mathcal{A}(K,L))$.
So $f$ consists of a collection of maps $f(K) \colon Mor_{H(\mathcal{A})}(K,L_2) \to Mor_{H(\mathcal{A})}(K,L_1)$
for every object $K$.

The existence and uniqueness of $\alpha$ follow immediately from $H(\mathcal{Y})$ being full and faithful.
\end{proof}
