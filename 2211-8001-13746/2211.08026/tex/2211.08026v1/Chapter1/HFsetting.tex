We assume that $M$ is symplectically aspherical, that is 
for every smooth map $u \colon S^2 \to M$, its symplectic area vanishes:
\[
    \int_{S^2}u^*\omega = 0.
\]
Moreover, we assume that all involved Lagrangian submanifolds are relatively symplectically aspherical, that is for every smooth map $u\colon D^2 \to M$ satisfying $u(\partial D^2) \subset L$, we have
\[
    \int_{D^2} u^*\omega =0.
\]
In particular, $S\subset M$ is relatively symplectically aspherical. 
This is automatic if $M$ is symplectically aspherical, unless $S$ has dimension $1$. In the latter case, the condition is equivalent to $S$ being a non-contractible circle. 
In this situation, Floer cohomology $\HF^*(f)$ for a symplectomorphism $f \in \Symp(M)$, and Lagrangian Floer cohomology $\HF^*(L,K)$ for Lagrangians $L,K$ as above can be defined over the universal Novikov field 
\[
\Lambda = \left\{ \sum a_k q^{\omega_k} \bigg \vert \vert a_k\in \Z_2, \omega_k \in \R,
\lim\limits_{k\to \infty}\omega_k = \infty
\right \}.
\]
$\HF^*(f)$ and $\HF^*(L,K)$ are $\Z_2$-graded, whenever $L$ and $K$ are oriented.

If in addition, the first Chern classes satisfy
$2c_1(M) = 0 \in \Homol^2(M;\Z)$, $2c_1(M;L) = 0 \in \Homol^2(M,L;\Z)$ and similarly for $K$, 
we can endow both Floer cohomology groups with a $\Z$-grading, as explained in \cite{seidel00}.
\end{comment}
We include a section about the definition of these groups for convenience of the reader in section
\ref{sec:ADD}. For a more detailed exposition, we refer the reader to \cite{DostSal, seidelthesis97, lee}
for $\HF^*(f)$ and to \cite{floer, oh1, oh_add} for $\HF^*(L,K)$ .

What follows is valid for $\Z_2$-gradings under the symplectically asphericity conditions, and it is also valid for $\Z$-gradings under the additional assumption on the Chern classes.
