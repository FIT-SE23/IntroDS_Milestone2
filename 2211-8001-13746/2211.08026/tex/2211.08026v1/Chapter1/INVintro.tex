We assume that $\tau_S=c \circ \tilde{c}$ for two anti-symplectic involutions $c, \tilde{c}\colon M \to M$ satisfying $c(S) = \tilde{c}(S) = S$.
In this section, we prove Theorem \ref{Ioutline_of_proof:thm:invariance},
i.e. that $\Phi(V_{MW})$ is Hamiltonian isotopic to $V_{MW}$, where
$
\Phi(x,y,z)= (c(y),c(x),z).
