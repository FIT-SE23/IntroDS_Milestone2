In this section we show Propositions \ref{prop:Lefschetz} and \ref{R:prop}.
This is based on work by Salepci \cite{Salepci} on real Lefschetz fibrations in the smooth setting.
Since we keep the discussion here relatively brief, we refer the interested reader to the following references for a more detailed treatment of (real) Lefschetz fibrations:
\cite{seidelbook, BC3, salepci2, keating}.
