In this section we recall the definition of Lagrangian cobordisms as studied by Biran and Cornea in the series of papers \cite{BC1, BC2, BC3}.
Let $(M,\omega)$ be a symplectic manifold.
Consider the product symplectic manifold $(M \times \R^2, \omega \oplus \omega_{\mathrm{std}})$.
Here, $\omega_{\mathrm{std}})= \mathrm{d}x \wedge \mathrm{d}y$ denotes the standard symplectic form on $\R^2$. We denote by $\pi \colon M \times \R^2 \to \R^2$ the projection to the plane.
For subsets $V \subset M \times \R^2$ and $Z\subset \R^2$, we write $V\vert_Z := V \cap \pi^{-1}(Z)$ for the restriction of $V$ over $Z$. 
A Lagrangian submanifold $V\subset M\times \R^2$ is called a \textit{Lagrangian cobordism} if there exists $R>0$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(i)] $$V \vert_{(-\infty, -R] \times \mathbb{R}} = \bigcup_{j=1}^{k_-} L_j \times (-\infty,-R] \times \{ j\}$$
	for some closed Lagrangian submanifolds $L_1, \dots, L_{k_-} \subset M$,
\item[(ii)] $$V \vert_{[R, \infty) \times \mathbb{R}} = \bigcup _{j=1}^{k_+} L_j' \times [R,\infty) \times \{j\}$$
	for some closed Lagrangian submanifolds $L_1', \dots, L_{k_+}' \subset M$,
\item[(iii)] $V\vert_{[-R,R]\times \mathbb{R}} \subset \mathbb{R}^2 \times M$ is compact.
\end{enumerate}
$V$ is called a Lagrangian cobordism from the Lagrangian family $(L_j')_{j=1, \dots, k_+}$
to the Lagrangian family $\left(L_i\right)_{i=1, \dots, k_-}$, denoted by
$$(L_j')_{j=1, \dots, k_+} \rightsquigarrow \left(L_i\right)_{i=1, \dots, k_-}.$$

\begin{comment}
\textit{Careful: in \cite{BC2}, they use "Lagrangians with cylindrical ends" for the above object, and "cobordism" only for the bulb within $[0,1]$. Maybe adapt the definition.}
