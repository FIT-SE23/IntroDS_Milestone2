We consider a symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ and a parametrized Lagrangian sphere $S\subset M$.
\begin{comment}
Our central object of study is the Dehn twist $\tau_S$ along $S$.

Mak-Wu \cite{MakWu} constructed a Lagrangian cobordism $V_{MW}$
with three ends: $S\times S, \Delta$ and $\Gamma_{\tau_S^{-1}}$.
\begin{comment}
More concretely, we consider the product $\left( M\times M, \omega \oplus -\omega\right)$
which we will denote by $M\times M^{-}$.
For a symplectomorphism $\phi$ on $M$, we denote by $\Gamma_{\Phi}$
the graph of $\phi$, which is a Lagrangian submanifold of $M\times M^-$.
For $\phi=\mathrm{id}$ this is the diagonal and we write $\Delta:= \Gamma_{\mathrm{id}}$.
With this notation, the cobordism 
$V_{MW}\subset \C \times M \times M^-$ has three ends: $S\times S, \Delta$ and $\Gamma_{\tau_S^{-1}}$.

In this section, we will recall the construction of this cobordism, which closely follows \cite{MakWu}.
