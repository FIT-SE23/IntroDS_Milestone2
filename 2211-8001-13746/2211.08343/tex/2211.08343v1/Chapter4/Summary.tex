Finally, a comprehensive summary of all the bounds on flavor conserving ALP--fermion couplings derived in the previous section is 
presented in Fig.~\ref{final_summary}. To be able to fairly compare all the different analysis, the limits on the $U(1)_{PQ}$ breaking
scale $f_a$ (expressed in GeV) are shown, for $m_a=0$ and by assuming the corresponding $c_i=1$, with all the other couplings 
set to 0. Therefore, the $f_a$ value plotted represents the highest energy scale tested, at present, in each decay channel. 
One can notice that the most stringent bounds on $f_a$ come from the top sector, trough the $m_t$ enhanced penguin contributions 
\cite{Gavela:2019wzg,Guerrera:2021yss}. From $K$ and $B$ hadronic pseudoscalar meson decays one tests $f_a \simeq (10^5-10^6)$ 
GeV. This is the lowest energy scale at which new physics in the ALP sector may appear, when a universal ALP-fermion coupling 
is assumed. $K\to \pi\,a$ decay provides the strongest bounds for all the ALP-quark couplings in the non-universal, but flavor 
conserving ALP-fermion scenario, with the only exception of the ALP-bottom coupling where the strongest bound comes from 
the $\Upsilon(ns)\to \gamma \,a$ decay \cite{Merlo:2019anv}. Bounds on $c_{t,c}$ enter from the penguin loop diagram, while 
bounds on $c_{u,d,s}$ are due to the tree-level amplitude contribution. Meson leptonic decays produces an upper bound on 
$f_a \simeq (10^{-1}-10)$ GeV in the ALP-lepton sector.
