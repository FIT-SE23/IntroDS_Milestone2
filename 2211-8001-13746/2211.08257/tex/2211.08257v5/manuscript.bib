Dangers can occur either when the intented manoeuvre is not well adjusted to the current traffic situation, or when the manoeuvre is not properly announced to the environment so that the intention is misinterpreted. When designing advanced driver assistance systems, it is beneficial to gather information about driver behaviors as accurately and early as possible. This work investigates early driver intention inference with hidden Markov models by observing easily accessible vehicle and environment signals such as pedal positions or global vehicle position on a digital map in real traffic.},

Current methods to estimate the driver’s experienced emotions use physiological sensing (e.g., skin-conductance, electroencephalography), speech, or facial expressions. However, drivers need to use wearable devices, perform explicit voice interaction, or require robust facial expressiveness. We present VEmotion (Virtual Emotion Sensor), a novel method to predict driver emotions in an unobtrusive way using contextual smartphone data. VEmotion analyzes information including traffic dynamics, environmental factors, in-vehicle context, and road characteristics to implicitly classify driver emotions. We demonstrate the applicability in a real-world driving study (N = 12) to evaluate the emotion prediction performance. Our results show that VEmotion outperforms facial expressions by 29\% in a person-dependent classification and by 8.5\% in a person-independent classification. We discuss how VEmotion enables empathic car interfaces to sense the driver’s emotions and will provide in-situ interface adaptations on-the-go.},

The driving behaviours are recognised by manoeuvring the signals of the driver and vehicle state information, and the recognised results are sent to the upper-layer HMM to recognise driving intentions. Also, driving behaviours in the near future are predicted using the likelihood-maximum method. A real-time driving simulator test on the combined working cases showed that the double-layer HMM can recognise driving intention and predict driving behaviour accurately and efficiently. As a result, the model provides the basis for pre-warning and intervention of danger and improving comfort performance.},

Emotions irrelevant to the working memory representation may interfere with the processing of relevant tasks and can influence task performance and behavior, making the accurate detection of cognitive load from nonverbal information challenging. This paper investigates automatic cognitive load detection from facial features, physiology and task performance under affective interference. Data was collected from participants (n=20) solving mental arithmetic tasks with emotional stimuli in the background and a combined classifier was used for detecting cognitive load levels. Results indicate that the face modality for cognitive load detection was more accurate under affective interference, whereas physiology and task performance were more accurate without the affective interference. Multimodal fusion improved detection accuracies, but it was less accurate under affective interferences. More specifically, the accuracy decreased with increasing intensity of emotional arousal.},

This is also fueled by parallel research in areas such as perception and control of robots, safe human-robot interaction, wearable systems, and the underpinning flexible/printed electronics technologies. Some of these are being routed to AVs. Growing number of network of sensors are being integrated into the vehicles for multi-modal interaction to draw correct inferences of the communicative cues from the user and to vary the interaction dynamics depending on the cognitive state of the user and contextual driving scenario. In response to this growing trend, this timely article presents a comprehensive review of the technologies that are being used or developed to perceive user's intentions for natural and intuitive in-vehicle interaction. The challenges that are needed to be overcome to attain truly interactive AVs, and their potential solutions are discussed along with various new avenues for future research.}

abstract = {In recent years, great strides have been made in the field of affective computing. Several models have been developed to represent and quantify emotions. Two popular ones include (i) categorical models which represent emotions as discrete labels, and (ii) dimensional models which represent emotions in a Valence-Arousal (VA) circumplex domain. However, there is no standard for annotation mapping between the two labelling methods. We build a novel algorithm for mapping categorical and dimensional model labels using annotation transfer across affective facial image datasets. Further, we utilize the transferred annotations to learn rich and interpretable data representations using a variational autoencoder (VAE). We present “LeVAsa”, a VAE model that learns implicit structure by aligning the latent space with the VA space. We evaluate the efficacy of LeVAsa by comparing performance with the Vanilla VAE using quantitative and qualitative analysis on two benchmark affective image datasets. Our results reveal that LeVAsa achieves high latent-circumplex alignment which leads to improved downstream categorical emotion prediction. The work also demonstrates the trade-off between degree of alignment and quality of reconstructions.},

The adoption of smartboards and smart-classroom setups have been the only innovation in teaching methodology.

Although teaching methodologies have been a part of the growing innovation, there is no way to measure or identify the emotions of a student during a lecture. The entire purpose of a lecture is to impart knowledge to the students and ensure maximum retention of the concept being taught. But, if a student is bored during or half-way through a lecture, it is very rare that he/she has been able to retain more than 50\% of the contents taught during that lecture. In this paper, we attempt to discuss potential solutions, based on Machine Learning, that can help track and identify student emotions during a classroom lecture.

  abstract = {Assistive robots can potentially improve the quality of life and personal independence of elderly people by supporting everyday life activities. To guarantee a safe and intuitive interaction between human and robot, human intentions need to be recognized automatically. As humans communicate their intentions multimodally, the use of multiple modalities for intention recognition may not just increase the robustness against failure of individual modalities but especially reduce the uncertainty about the intention to be recognized. This is desirable as particularly in direct interaction between robots and potentially vulnerable humans a minimal uncertainty about the situation as well as knowledge about this actual uncertainty is necessary. Thus, in contrast to existing methods, in this work a new approach for multimodal intention recognition is introduced that focuses on uncertainty reduction through classifier fusion. For the four considered modalities speech, gestures, gaze directions and scene objects individual intention classifiers are trained, all of which output a probability distribution over all possible intentions. By combining these output distributions using the Bayesian method Independent Opinion Pool [1] the uncertainty about the intention to be recognized can be decreased. The approach is evaluated in a collaborative human-robot interaction task with a 7-DoF robot arm. The results show that fused classifiers, which combine multiple modalities, outperform the respective individual base classifiers with respect to increased accuracy, robustness, and reduced uncertainty.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an ensemble classification model with unsupervised feature learning for driving stress recognition under real-world driving conditions. The driving stress is detected using drivers' different physiological signals, specifically the electromyogram, electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response, heart rate and respiration. The proposed model consists of two modules: 1) a multilayer representation learning module using autoencoder as its building block. The autoencoders are trained with a quasi-automated, non-gradient descent based unsupervised learning algorithm; 2) an ensemble classification module under the AdaBoost framework. The proposed model is completely data driven, does not require additional feature extraction and feature selection process, and can perform in an end-to-end way in which it takes the physiological signal as the input instead of the handcrafted features. Experimental results show that our proposed model can effectively recognize the driving stress with fewer physiological sensors compared with most of state of the art methods. Experiments also demonstrate that the proposed model can simplify the model structure tuning and improve the learning efficiency compared with the baseline deep learning model.},

We augment this original driver-annotated data with third-party annotations of perceived safety, in order to explore potential driver overconfidence. We show that fusing automotive, physiological, and visual data allows us to predict driver labels of availability, achieving an 0.874 F1-score by extracting statistically relevant features and training with our proposed deep neural network, PazNet. Using the same data and network, we achieve an 0.891 F1-score for predicting third-party labeled safe moments.

A 26-item questionnaire is developed in accordance with the model and a survey conducted to evaluate 6 autonomy scenarios. In a pilot survey (n = 54) and follow-up survey (n = 187), the AVAM presented good internal consistency and replicated patterns from previous surveys. Results showed that users were less accepting of high autonomy levels and displayed significantly lower intention to use highly autonomous vehicles. We also assess expected driving engagement of hands, feet and eyes which are shown to be lower for full autonomy compared with all other autonomy levels. This highlighted that partial autonomy , regardless of level, is perceived to require uniformly higher driver engagement than full autonomy. These results can inform experts regarding public perception of autonomy across SAE levels. The AVAM and associated questionnaire enable standardised evaluation of AVs across studies, allowing for meaningful assessment of changes in perception over time and between different technologies.

In this paper, a scheme for detecting cell-phone use that is based on deep learning is proposed, which can eliminate the potential risk by detecting the driver behavior and issuing an early warning. The proposed scheme consists of two stages: model training and practical testing. In the former, a multi-angle arrangement of cameras is first designed. Then, based on self-established data set, two independent convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained by optimizing the size and number of the convolution kernels, which can efficiently recognize cell-phones and hands in real time. In the testing stage, dynamic region extraction and skin color detection are employed as preprocessing to improve the accuracy of target recognition. Then, with the trained CNNs, the detection of cell-phone and hand targets is carried out, and the corresponding early warning is issued based on the distance of the interaction between the cell-phone and the hand. Numerous experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can accurately detect cell-phone use during driving in real time, with a running time of 144 fps and an accuracy of 95.7\%.},

  abstract = {An important goal in automotive user interface research is to predict a user's reactions and behaviors in a driving environment. The behavior of both drivers and passengers can be studied by analyzing eye gaze, head, hand, and foot movement, upper body posture, etc. In this paper, we focus on estimating head pose, which has been shown to be a good predictor of driver intent and a good proxy for gaze estimation, and provide a valuable head pose database for future comparative studies. Most existing head pose estimation algorithms are still struggling under large spatial head turns. Our method, however, relies on using facial features that are visible even during large spatial head turns to estimate head pose. The method is evaluated on the LISA-P Head Pose database, which has head pose data from on-road daytime and nighttime drivers of varying age, race, and gender; ground truth for head pose is provided using a motion capture system. In special regards to eye gaze estimation for automotive user interface study, the automatic head pose estimation technique presented in this paper can replace previous eye gaze estimation methods that rely on manual data annotation or be used in conjunction with them when necessary.}

  abstract = {For a fixed sample size, a common phenomenon is that the error of a designed classifier decreases and then increases as the number of features grows. This peaking phenomenon has been recognized for forty years and depends on the classification rule and feature-label distribution. Historically, the peaking phenomenon has been treated by assuming a fixed ordering of the features, usually beginning with the strongest individual feature and proceeding with features of decreasing individual classification capability. This does not take into account feature-selection, which is commonplace in high-dimensional and small sample settings. This paper revisits the peaking phenomenon in the presence of feature-selection. Using massive simulation in a high-performance computing environment, the paper considers various combinations of feature-label models, feature-selection algorithms, and classifier models to produce a large library of error versus feature size curves. Owing to the prevalence of feature-selection in genomic classification, we also consider gene-expression-based classification of breast-cancer patient prognosis. Results vary widely and are strongly dependent on the combination. The error curves tend to fall into three categories: peaking, settling into a plateau, or falling very slowly over a long range of feature set sizes. It can be concluded that one should be wary of applying peaking results found in the absence of feature-selection to settings in which feature-selection is employed.},

  abstract = {The quality of buildings, including their performance in a range of indoor environmental attributes, is influential to the living quality of habitants. Many studies on appropriate importance weights for the attributes have been reported but few embraced both human perception of the importance of such attributes and the related performance of buildings. Focusing on typical public and private high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong, users' perceived importance of four key attributes, namely thermal comfort, air cleanliness, odour and noise, and their perceived performance of the buildings in these attributes were studied. Perceptions collected from 563 respondents were processed through an analytical hierarchy process to generate importance weights for the attributes. Correlation analyses corroborate that perceived importance may vary among buildings of different types and between residents and visitors. Thermal comfort was perceived by the vast majority as the most important. Using a performance-importance plot, it is shown how the gaps between perceived performance and perceived importance can be identified. The results can help determine the areas for improvement in new building designs and facilitate prioritization of limited resources for upgrading building performance.}

The overall IEQ acceptance is calculated from a multivariate logistic regression model. A range of acceptance in typical office environmental conditions and its dependence on the four parameters stated above are determined for design conditions. The proposed overall IEQ acceptance can be used as a quantitative assessment criterion for an office environment and similar environment where an occupant's evaluation is expected.},

The degree of drowsiness was assessed based on a performance dimension by analyzing the driver's steering behavior. With partial and conditional vehicle automation on the horizon, these input signals will no longer be available. Nevertheless, knowledge about the driver's state, e.g. the attentional level or take-over readiness, becomes even more important. Currently and in the near future, interior vehicle cameras are a major source of driver status information. Furthermore, various built-in sensors are under development to complement in-vehicle cameras and possibly vehicle operation. For specific tasks, wearable sensors connected via smartphone can play a prominent role as well. The paper describes this evolution of the sensor approach supplemented by related research findings from Bosch Corporate Research and integrates it in the technical, business, and regulatory context. Thus, the industry perspective should stimulate the discussion and initiate future academic research in the field.},

  abstract = {The effective assessment of drivers' driving capability under the condition of an advanced driver assistance system is of great significance to the precise switching of driving rights between human and machine and the promotion of the development of man-computer collaboration. In this study, real-time collected warning data from bus driver state monitoring system (DSMS) and advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) were utilized to determine the drivers' comprehensive driving capability indicators. The information utility and interaction of the indicators were considered, and an integrated weight method based on standard deviations was proposed. This method was used to combine the entropy weight method and improved analytic network process (ANP), to evaluate the drivers' comprehensive driving capability under man-computer cooperative driving conditions in real time. The results show that the entropy weight method and improved ANP algorithm have good consistency and are significantly correlated and that the integrated weight method is effective and dependable. The top four indicators in the integrated weighting results were eye closure (0.241), yawn (0.210), rapid deceleration (0.186), and lane departure (0.159). Drivers' comprehensive driving capability scores were concentrated in the score range of 1 to 6, with the lowest scores in zones A and B for stages 2, 11 and 21. Therefore, it is necessary to further explore the relationship between driver behavior, vehicle status and road traffic environment within the score range of 1 to 6 so that the man-computer interaction can be optimized and the driver's comprehensive driving capability can be improved.},

  abstract = {Vigilance or sustained attention is an important aspect for people who engaged in long time attention demanding tasks such as monotonous monitoring and driving. Vigilance detection has been an important topic in the field of brain-computer interface (BCI) research. However, the study is limited due to the low SNR(Signal-Noise Ratio) nature of EEG. Common spatial pattern (CSP) is a one of the most effective algorithms for feature extraction method in the BCI study area. The CSP seeks for an optimal projection direction (spatial filter) by maximizing the variance of one class and simultaneously minimizing the variance of the other class. There is one drawbacks exists in the traditional CSP, that is, the CSP is proposed relies on the assumption that data in each class follow the Gaussian distribution. However, this assumption is not always true for EEG data in practice, especially in the research of vigilance detection based EEG (e.g. during sleep). Thus, traditional CSP suffers performance degradation in case of non-Gaussian distributions. In this paper, we extend the traditional CSP to the general version and proposed nonparametric CSP (NCSP) algorithms which do not explicitly rely on the assumption of the underlying class Gaussian distribution and we then develop a new efficient algorithm based on matrix deflation to solve the proposed NCSP algorithm and its extensions-nonparametric multi-class CSP (NMCSP). Experimental results on EEG-based vigilance estimation and motor imagery recognition task demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.},

  abstract = {Understanding driver activity is vital for in-vehicle systems that aim to reduce the incidence of car accidents rooted in cognitive distraction. Automating real-time behavior recognition while ensuring actions classification with high accuracy is however challenging, given the multitude of circumstances surrounding drivers, the unique traits of individuals, and the computational constraints imposed by in-vehicle embedded platforms. Prior work fails to jointly meet these runtime/accuracy requirements and mostly rely on a single sensing modality, which in turn can be a single point of failure. In this paper, we harness the exceptional feature extraction abilities of deep learning and propose a dedicated Interwoven Deep Convolutional Neural Network (InterCNN) architecture to tackle the problem of accurate classification of driver behaviors in real-time. The proposed solution exploits information from multi-stream inputs, i.e., in-vehicle cameras with different fields of view and optical flows computed based on recorded images, and merges through multiple fusion layers abstract features that it extracts. This builds a tight ensembling system, which significantly improves the robustness of the model. In addition, we introduce a temporal voting scheme based on historical inference instances, in order to enhance the classification accuracy. Experiments conducted with a dataset that we collect in a mock-up car environment demonstrate that the proposed InterCNN with MobileNet convolutional blocks can classify 9 different behaviors with 73.97\% accuracy, and 5 `aggregated' behaviors with 81.66\% accuracy. We further show that our architecture is highly computationally efficient, as it performs inferences within 15 ms, which satisfies the real-time constraints of intelligent cars. Nevertheless, our InterCNN is robust to lossy input, as the classification remains accurate when two input streams are occluded.},

To increase the feasibility and wearability of EmotionMeter in real-world applications, we design a six-electrode placement above the ears to collect electroencephalography (EEG) signals. We combine EEG and eye movements for integrating the internal cognitive states and external subconscious behaviors of users to improve the recognition accuracy of EmotionMeter. The experimental results demonstrate that modality fusion with multimodal deep neural networks can significantly enhance the performance compared with a single modality, and the best mean accuracy of 85.11\% is achieved for four emotions (happy, sad, fear, and neutral). We explore the complementary characteristics of EEG and eye movements for their representational capacities and identify that EEG has the advantage of classifying happy emotion, whereas eye movements outperform EEG in recognizing fear emotion. To investigate the stability of EmotionMeter over time, each subject performs the experiments three times on different days. EmotionMeter obtains a mean recognition accuracy of 72.39\% across sessions with the six-electrode EEG and eye movement features. These experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of EmotionMeter within and between sessions.},

We found interfaces communicating vehicle awareness and intent: (1) can help pedestrians attempting to cross; (2) are not limited to the vehicle and can exist in the environment; and (3) should use a combination of modalities such as visual, auditory, and physical.},

Communication from autonomous vehicles to vulnerable road users can ease the introduction of and aids in understanding the intention of these. Various modalities and messages to communicate have been proposed and evaluated. However, a concise design space building on work from communication theory is yet to be presented. Therefore, we want to share our work on such a design space consisting of 4 dimensions: Message Type, Modality, Locus, and Communication Participants.},

  abstract = {What are pedestrian attitudes towards driverless vehicles that have no human driver? In this paper, we use virtual reality to simulate a virtual scene where pedestrians interact with driverless vehicles. This was an exploratory study where 15 users encounter a driverless vehicle at a crosswalk in the virtual scene. Data was collected in the form of video and audio recordings, semi-structured interview and participant sketches to explain the crosswalk scenes they experience. An interaction design framework for vehicle-pedestrian interaction in an autonomous vehicle has been suggested which can be used to design and model driverless vehicle behaviour before the autonomous vehicle technology is deployed widely.},

  abstract = {Automation is often problematic because people fail to rely upon it appropriately. Because people respond to technology socially, trust influences reliance on automation. In particular, trust guides reliance when complexity and unanticipated situations make a complete understanding of the automation impractical. This review considers trust from the organizational, sociological, interpersonal, psychological, and neurological perspectives. It considers how the context, automation characteristics, and cognitive processes affect the appropriateness of trust. The context in which the automation is used influences automation performance and provides a goal-oriented perspective to assess automation characteristics along a dimension of attributional abstraction. These characteristics can influence trust through analytic, analogical, and affective processes. The challenges of extrapolating the concept of trust in people to trust in automation are discussed. A conceptual model integrates research regarding trust in automation and describes the dynamics of trust, the role of context, and the influence of display characteristics. Actual or potential applications of this research include improved designs of systems that require people to manage imperfect automation.},

  abstract = {One long-standing challenge in robotics is the realization of mobile autonomous robots able to operate safely in human workplaces, and be accepted by the human occupants. We describe the development of a multiton robotic forklift intended to operate alongside people and vehicles, handling palletized materials within existing, active outdoor storage facilities. The system has four novel characteristics. The first is a multimodal interface that allows users to efficiently convey task-level commands to the robot using a combination of pen-based gestures and natural language speech. These tasks include the manipulation, transport, and placement of palletized cargo within dynamic, human-occupied warehouses. The second is the robot's ability to learn the visual identity of an object from a single user-provided example and use the learned model to reliably and persistently detect objects despite significant spatial and temporal excursions. The third is a reliance on local sensing that allows the robot to handle variable palletized cargo and navigate within dynamic, minimally prepared environments without a global positioning system. The fourth concerns the robot's operation in close proximity to people, including its human supervisor, pedestrians who may cross or block its path, moving vehicles, and forklift operators who may climb inside the robot and operate it manually. This is made possible by interaction mechanisms that facilitate safe, effective operation around people. This paper provides a comprehensive description of the system's architecture and implementation, indicating how real-world operational requirements motivated key design choices. We offer qualitative and quantitative analyses of the robot operating in real settings and discuss the lessons learned from our effort.},

  abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AV's) are appearing on roads, based on standard robotic mapping and navigation algorithms. However their ability to interact with other road-users is much less well understood. If AVs are programmed to stop every time another road user obstructs them, then other road users simply learn that they can take priority at every interaction, and the AV will make little or no progress. This issue is especially important in the case of a pedestrian crossing the road in front of the AV. The present methods paper expands the sequential chicken model introduced in (Fox et al., 2018), using empirical data to measure behavior of humans in a controlled plus-maze experiment, and showing how such data can be used to infer parameters of the model via a Gaussian Process. This providing a more realistic, empirical understanding of the human factors intelligence required by future autonomous vehicles.},

  abstract = {When pedestrians encounter vehicles, they typically stop and wait for a signal from the driver to either cross or wait. What happens when the car is autonomous and there isn't a human driver to signal them? This paper seeks to address this issue with an intent communication system (ICS) that acts in place of a human driver. This intent system has been developed to take into account the psychology behind what pedestrians are familiar with and what they expect from machines. The system integrates those expectations into the design of physical systems and mathematical algorithms. The goal of the system is to ensure that communication is simple, yet effective without leaving pedestrians with a sense of distrust in autonomous vehicles. To validate the ICS, two types of experiments have been run: field tests with an autonomous vehicle to determine how humans actually interact with the ICS and simulations to account for multiple potential behaviors.The results from both experiments show that humans react positively and more predictably when the intent of the vehicle is communicated compared to when the intent of the vehicle is unknown. In particular, the results from the simulation specifically showed a 142 percent difference between the pedestrian's trust in the vehicle's actions when the ICS is enabled and the pedestrian has prior knowledge of the vehicle than when the ICS is not enabled and the pedestrian having no prior knowledge of the vehicle.},

Represented as a Dynamic Bayesian Network, OPTIMo infers beliefs over the human's moment-to-moment latent trust states, based on the history of observed interaction experiences. A separate model instance is trained on each user's experiences, leading to an interpretable and personalized characterization of that operator's behaviors and attitudes. Using datasets collected from an interaction study with a large group of roboticists, we empirically assess OPTIMo's performance under a broad range of configurations. These evaluation results highlight OPTIMo's advances in both prediction accuracy and responsiveness over several existing trust models. This accurate and near real-time human robot trust measure makes possible the development of autonomous robots that can adapt their behaviors dynamically, to actively seek greater trust and greater efficiency within future human-robot collaborations.},

Here, we present recent and ongoing research that explores the consequences for human interaction with increasingly intelligent (whether semi- or fully autonomous) vehicles. We highlight in particular that the driver's perception of a vehicle's intelligence affects driver behaviour and argue that this effect can be explicitly considered in UX design. Our current research explores this in more detail for eco-driving feedback design. Overall, the research discussed here covers three research projects, the recently finished CARS (investigating the connection between perceived intelligence and driver behaviour) and UMIF (focusing on trust in automation) projects, as well as the ongoing TIEB project (focusing on intelligent eco-driving feedback). Our perspective and results so far have implications for the design of future vehicle UX at several levels of automation.},

Participants using a driving simulator drove either a normal car, an autonomous vehicle able to control steering and speed, or a comparable autonomous vehicle augmented with additional anthropomorphic features\textemdash name, gender, and voice. Behavioral, physiological, and self-report measures revealed that participants trusted that the vehicle would perform more competently as it acquired more anthropomorphic features.

The problem involves both the proliferation of narrow intra-disciplinary research definitions of trust and the multiple meanings the word trust possesses in everyday use. To enable trust researchers to more easily compare empirical results, we define a cohesive set of conceptual and measurable constructs that captures the essence of trust and distrust definitions across several disciplines. This chapter defines disposition to trust (and -distrust) constructs from psychology and economics, institution-based trust (and -distrust) constructs from sociology, and trusting/distrusting beliefs, trusting/distrusting intentions, and trust/distrust-related behavior constructs from social psychology and other disciplines. Distrust concepts are defined as separate and opposite from trust concepts. We conclude by discussing the importance of viewing trust and distrust as separate, simultaneously operating concepts.},

For the initial surveys described in this paper, we selected two domains: automotive and medical. Specifically, we focused on driverless cars (e.g., Google Cars) and automated medical diagnoses (e.g., IBM's Watson). There were two dimensions for each survey: the safety criticality of the situation in which the system was being used and name-brand recognizability. We designed the surveys and administered them electronically, using Survey Monkey and Amazon's Mechanical Turk. We then performed statistical analyses of the survey results to discover common factors across the domains, domain-specific factors, and implications of safety criticality and brand recognizability on trust factors. We found commonalities as well as dissimilarities in factors between the two domains, suggesting the possibility of creating a core model of trust that could be modified for individual domains. The results of our research will allow for the creation of design guidelines for autonomous systems that will be better accepted and used by target populations.}

In addition, we articulate the need to carefully attend to the fact that color comprises three attributes\textemdash hue, lightness, and chroma\textemdash in creating color manipulations in experimental work. We close by highlighting the conceptual, empirical, and practical implications of viewing color as a functional, as well as aesthetic, stimulus, and by sounding the call for more research in this important yet overlooked area.},

Hence, new HCI designs need to fill this gap. This work presents the implementation and comparison of different interaction concepts in virtual reality (VR). They were derived after an analysis of 28 works from research and industry, which were classified into five groups according to their complexity and the type of communication. We implemented one concept per group for a within-subject experiment in VR. For each concept, we varied if the AV is going to stop and how early it starts to activate its display. We observed effects on safety, trust, and user experience. A good concept displays information on the street, uses unambiguous signals (e.g., green lights) and has high visibility. Additional feedback, such as continuously showing the recognized pedestrian's location, seem to be unnecessary and may irritate.},

In this paper, we report an experiment to investigate how people perceived different designs of robot embodiments in terms of animacy and intelligence. iCat and Robovie II were used as the two embodiments in this experiment. We conducted a between-subject experiment where robot type was the independent variable, and perceived animacy and intelligence of the robot were the dependent variables. Our findings suggest that a robot's perceived intelligence is significantly correlated with animacy. The correlation between the intelligence and the animacy of a robot was observed to be stronger in the case of the iCat embodiment. Our results also indicate that the more animated the face of the robot, the more likely it is to attract the attention of a user. We also discuss the possible and probable explanations of the results obtained.},

How autonomous assistance impacts trust in automation as well as how trust affects human calibration and use of automation has been investigated for both dynamic contexts, including the internal variables (e.g., cultural characteristics) and external factors (e.g., system settings). Having standardized measures to capture trust and its antecedents is particularly critical to understanding how factors associated with the human operators and autonomous applications affects the way they are used. This paper reports the development of a trust instrument and several rounds of cross-country validation, including U.S., German, Taiwanese, and Turkish populations.

  abstract = {Introduction An accurate determination of body temperature in critically ill patients is a fundamental requirement for initiating the proper process of diagnosis, and also therapeutic actions; therefore, the aim of the study was to assess the accuracy and precision of four noninvasive peripheral methods of temperature measurement compared to the central nasopharyngeal measurement. Methods In this observational prospective study, 237 patients were recruited from the intensive care unit of Imam Ali Hospital of Kermanshah. The patients' body temperatures were measured by four peripheral methods; oral, axillary, tympanic, and forehead along with a standard central nasopharyngeal measurement. After data collection, the results were analyzed by paired t-test, kappa coefficient, receiver operating characteristic curve, and using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 19, software. Results There was a significant meaningful correlation between all the peripheral methods when compared with the central measurement (P{$<$}0.001). Kappa coefficients showed good agreement between the temperatures of right and left tympanic membranes and the standard central nasopharyngeal measurement (88\%). Paired t-test demonstrated an acceptable precision with forehead (P=0.132), left (P=0.18) and right (P=0.318) tympanic membranes, oral (P=1.00), and axillary (P=1.00) methods. Sensitivity and specificity of both the left and right tympanic membranes were more than for other methods. Conclusion The tympanic and forehead methods had the highest and lowest accuracy for measuring body temperature, respectively. It is recommended to use the tympanic method (right and left) for assessing a patient's body temperature in the intensive care units because of high accuracy and acceptable precision.},

Small variations in brain temperature may confer or mitigate a substantial degree of neuroprotection, which may be lost at temperatures near 37\textdegree C. The purpose of this study was to define the relationship between brain and core temperature after cardiac arrest through direct, simultaneous measurement of both. We placed intracranial monitors in a series of consecutive patients hospitalized for cardiac arrest at a single tertiary care facility within 12 hours of return of spontaneous circulation to guide postcardiac arrest care. We compared the absolute difference between brain and core (esophageal or rectal) temperature measurements every hour for the duration of intracranial monitoring and tested for a lag between brain and core temperature using the average square difference method. Overall, 11 patients underwent simultaneous brain and core temperature monitoring for a total of 906 hours of data (Median 95; IQR: 15\textendash 118 hours per subject). On average, brain temperature was 0.34C\textdegree{} (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.31\textendash 0.37) higher than core temperature. In 7\% of observations, brain temperature exceeded the measured core temperature {$\geq$}1\textdegree C. Brain temperature lagged behind core temperature by 0.45 hours (95\% CI\,=\,-0.27\textendash 1.27 hours). Brain temperature averages 0.34\textdegree C higher than core temperature after cardiac arrest, and is more than 1\textdegree C higher than core temperature 7\% of the time. This phenomenon must be considered when carrying out TTM to a goal core temperature of {$<$}36\textdegree C.},

Pursuing the identification of effective physiological sensing systems for enhancing flexibility of human-centered and distributed control, using machine learning algorithms, we have investigated how heat flux sensing could improve personal thermal comfort inference under transient ambient conditions. We have explored the variations of heat exchange rates of facial and wrist skin. These areas are often exposed in indoor environments and contribute to the thermoregulation mechanism through skin heat exchange, which we have coupled with variations of skin and ambient temperatures for inference of personal thermal preferences. Adopting an experimental and data analysis methodology, we have evaluated the modeling of personal thermal preference of 18 human subjects for well-known classifiers using different scenarios of learning. The experimental measurements have revealed the differences in personal thermal preferences and how they are reflected in physiological variables. Further, we have shown that heat exchange rates have high potential in improving the performance of personal inference models even compared to the use of skin temperature.},

Data were collected from an overhead colour and depth (RGB-D) camera, while gold standard physiologic data were captured from the hospital's patient monitor. We developed a deep learning algorithm for automatic detection of the face and chest area of the neonate. We then use this algorithm to identify time periods with low patient motion and to locate regions of interest for RR estimation. We produce a respiration signal by quantifying the chest movement using the raw RGB video, motion-magnified RGB video, and depth video. We compare this to a respiration signal derived from the changes in the green channel of the face. We were able to estimate RR from motion-magnified video and depth video, achieving a mean absolute error of less than 3.5 BPM for 69\% and 67\% of the time for each stream, respectively. We achieve this result without the need for skin segmentation and can apply our technique to fully clothed neonatal patients. We show that similar performance can be achieved using the depth and colour stream using this technique.},

  abstract = {A personal comfort model is an approach to thermal comfort modeling, for thermal environmental design and control, that predicts an individual's thermal comfort response, instead of the average response of a large population. We developed personal thermal comfort models using lab grade wearable in normal daily activities. We collected physiological signals (e.g., skin temperature, heart rate) of 14 subjects (6 female and 8 male adults) and environmental parameters (e.g., air temperature, relative humidity) for 2\textendash 4 weeks (at least 20\,h per day). Then we trained 14 models for each subject with different machine-learning algorithms to predict their thermal preference. The results show that the median prediction power could be up to 24\%/78\%/0.79 (Cohen's kappa/accuracy/AUC) with all features considered. The median prediction power reaches 21\%/71\%/0.7 after 200 subjective votes. We explored the importance of different features on the prediction performance by considering all subjects in one dataset. When all features included for the entire dataset, personal comfort models can generate the highest performance of 35\%/76\%/0.80 by the most predictive algorithm. Personal comfort models display the highest prediction power when occupants' thermal sensations is outside thermal neutrality. Skin temperature measured at the ankle is more predictive than measured at the wrist. We suggest that Cohen's kappa or AUC should be employed to assess the performance of personal thermal comfort models for imbalanced datasets due to the capacity to exclude random success.},

  abstract = {Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems play a key role in shaping the built environment. However, centralized HVAC systems cannot guarantee the provision of a comfortable thermal environment for everyone. Therefore, a personalized HVAC system that aims to adapt thermal preferences has drawn much more attention. Meanwhile, occupant-related factors like skin temperature have not had standardized measurement methods. Therefore, this paper proposes to use infrared thermography to develop individual thermal models to predict thermal sensations using three different feature sets with the random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). The results have shown the correlation coefficients between clothing surface temperature and thermal sensation are 11\% and 3\% higher than those between skin temperature and thermal sensation of two subjects, respectively. With cross-validation, SVM with a linear kernel and penalty number of 1, as well as RF with 50 trees and the maximum tree depth of 3 were selected as the model configurations. As a result, the model trained with the feature set, consisting of indoor air temperature, relative humidity, skin temperature and clothing surface temperature, and with linear kernel SVM has achieved 100\% recall score on test data of female subjects and 95\% recall score on that of male subjects.},

Although the accuracy of the forecasting is similar for both the feed-forward and the recurrent network, the removal of features leads to accuracy reduction much earlier for the feed-forward network. The recurrent network can perform well even with less than 50\% of features. This brings significant benefits in scenarios, where the neural network is used as a blackbox model of thermal comfort, which is called by an optimizer that minimizes the deviance from a target value. The reduction of input dimensionality can lead to reduction of costs related to measurement equipment, data transfer and also computational demands of optimization.},

  abstract = {Forecasting of energy consumption in Smart Buildings (SB) and using the extracted information to plan and operate power generation are crucial elements of the Smart Grid (SG) energy management. Prediction of electrical loads and scheduling the generation resources to match the demand enable the utility to mitigate the energy generation cost. Different methodologies have been employed to predict energy consumption at different levels of distribution and transmission systems. In this paper, a novel hybrid deep learning model is proposed to predict energy consumption in smart buildings. The proposed framework consists of two stages, namely, data cleaning, and model building. The data cleaning phase applies pre-processing techniques to the raw data and adds additional features of lag values. In the model-building phase, the hybrid model is trained on the processed data. The hybrid deep learning (DL) model is based on the stacking of fully connected layers, and unidirectional Long Short Term Memory (LSTMs) on bi-directional LSTMs. The proposed model is designed to capture the temporal dependencies of energy consumption on dependent features and to be effective in terms of computational complexity, training time, and forecasting accuracy. The proposed model is evaluated on two benchmark energy consumption datasets yielding superior performance in terms of accuracy when compared with widely used hybrid models such as Convolutional (Conv) Neural Network-LSTM, ConvLSTM, LSTM encoder-decoder model, stacking models, etc. A mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.00\% for case study 1 and a MAPE of 3.71\% for case study 2 is obtained for the proposed forecasting DL model in comparison with LSTM-based models that yielded 7.80\% MAPE and 5.099\% MAPE for two datasets respectively. The proposed model has also been applied for multi-step week-ahead daily forecasting with an improvement of 8.368\% and 20.99\% in MAPE against the LSTM-based model for the utilized energy consumption datasets respectively.},

  abstract = {Prior knowledge of occupants' thermal comfort can facilitate informed control decision of ambient thermal-conditioning in a building environment. This paper investigates the possibility to predict human thermal state (Comfort/Discomfort) from the information of physiological parameters. As gender difference has been widely linked with thermal comfort perception, a four-fold objective is adopted: first, investigating gender differences in subjective thermal perception; second, investigating gender differences in physiological response under different thermal states; third, identifying those physiological features that have the potential to predict thermal state, and fourth, establishing a data-driven thermal state prediction model for each gender group using the identified features. Human subject experiments were conducted, during which five physiological responses (hand skin temperature STh, hand skin conductance SCh, pulse rate PR, blood oxygen saturation SpO2, blood pressure BP) and four subjective responses (thermal comfort, thermal preference, humidity sensation, airflow sensation) were recorded in conjunction with a thermal sensation survey while environmental conditions varied from cold/cool to neutral levels (18\textdegree C-27{$\circ$}C). Additionally, derivative features namely change rate (FOG) and mean squared gradient (MSG) of each physiological parameter were examined. Rigorous statistical analysis and subsequent predictive modeling utilizing Random Forest algorithm were implemented. Results demonstrate significant gender difference in several subjective and physiological responses. The features identified for males (SpO2-MSG/STh/STh-FOG/STh-MSG/SCh/SCh-FOG/SCh-MSG) and females (STh-FOG/STh-MSG/SCh/SCh-MSG/PR/PR-MSG) could accurately predict 92.86\% and 94.29\% of thermal states, respectively. This study indicates that the thermal state of a person can be identified by monitoring physiological parameters from non-intrusive body locations using wearable sensing technology.},

Gender differences have been generally considered to be small and insignificant but this review shows that a growing number of studies have found significant differences in thermal comfort between the genders. Clearly more than half of the laboratory and field studies have found that females express more dissatisfaction than males in the same thermal environments. Very few studies have found males to be more dissatisfied than females. A meta-analysis shows that females are more likely than males to express thermal dissatisfaction (ratio: 1.74, 95\% confidence interval: 1.61\textendash 1.89). However, most studies found no significant difference in neutral temperatures between the genders. Females are more sensitive than males to a deviation from an optimal temperature and express more dissatisfaction, especially in cooler conditions. Practical Implications We should no longer neglect the more rigorous requirements that females have for indoor thermal environments. Gender differences indicate that females have, on average, a greater need for individual temperature control and adaptive actions than males. The results of this review suggest that females should primarily be used as subjects when examining indoor thermal comfort requirements, as if females are satisfied it is highly probable that males are also satisfied.},

Pervasive computing technologies via biopotential and behavioral parameters may represent a solution of robust pain recognition in clinical context and everyday life. In this work, multi-modal fusion of video and biopotential signals is used to recognize pain in a person-independent scenario. For this purpose, participants were recruited to subject to painful heat stimuli under controlled conditions. Subsequently, a multitude of features via biopotentials and behavior signals has been extracted and selected from the available modalities. Biopotential and video features were fused with an early and late fusion, we could show that the classification between baseline vs. tolerance threshold has an accuracy of 80 \% via late fusion. The data support the concept of automated and objected pain recognition of experimental pain. There are plans for a clinical project in which detection will occur postoperatively in humans.},

The psychological and physiological changes brought by different emotion states may have some impact on people's perception to thermal environment. The objective of this study is to investigate whether emotion state would have some influence on people's thermal perception and comfort. In this study, experiments were carried out. Eighteen college students were recruited in the experiments. Their emotion states were induced to be joyful (positive) or boring (negative) by watching videos which would arouse intended negative or positive emotions. There was no emotion induction for neutral state. The experiments were conducted in three temperature conditions (21\textdegree C, 24\textdegree C and 27\textdegree C) and three activity levels (sitting, standing and exercising). Subjective questionnaires about participants' emotion state, thermal sensation, thermal comfort, thermal expectation and thermal environment satisfaction were collected. Physiological parameters were measured including skin temperature, heart rate, blood pressure and heart rate variability. The results showed that emotion state affected thermal perception and comfort only while sitting and standing and not during exercise. For the two light activities, subjects' thermal comfort vote for boring emotion was significantly higher than that of joyful and neutral state, which meant that subjects' felt less comfortable under boring emotion. The thermal sensation vote of boring emotion became higher. Participants tended to be warmer in boring emotion state. The results about thermal satisfaction vote and thermal expectation also indicated that the evaluation gets worse in boring state. The analysis of physiological parameters showed that, in light activities, both systolic blood pressure and heart rate increased under boring state compared to neutral and joyful state. The heart rate variability index (LF/HF) was higher under boring state and lower under joyful state than that of neutral state. Both systolic pressure and heart rate were found to be positively correlated with thermal sensation vote in different emotion states, while higher LF/HF was related to less thermal comfort conditions. During exercising, subjective questionnaires and physiological parameters did not change significantly with different emotion states.},

Skin temperature, through its heat-transfer properties, plays a significant role in the thermoregulation principle that governs thermal comfort. This paper presents a method termed as Predicted Thermal State (PTS) model, which uses the peripheral skin temperature and its gradient features from a single body location to evaluate the thermal state. The model introduces a novel normalization process to resolve both inter and intra individual differences by incorporating body surface area and clothing insulation, respectively. Human subject experiments were conducted, during which each subject's skin temperatures and respective thermal sensation surveys were recorded while environmental conditions varied from cold/cool-to-neutral levels (18\textdegree C-27\textdegree C). This study revealed that the combined information of skin temperature and its gradient carry significant potential to establish the thermal state. Four model input cases were compared using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) based classifiers. While non-normalized skin temperature alone could accurately estimate only about 65\% of thermal states, the PTS model based on normalized skin features accurately predicted 87\% of thermal states.}

While quantifying thermal comfort, human biometric data and environmental data from various environments are needed. Therefore, we proposed a method to estimate human thermal comfort through regression analysis with human biometric data acquired by wearable sensors. Since the PMV model is generally used to evaluate human thermal comfort, the PMV value as the correct thermal comfort could be calculated from the PMV formula. We constructed an experiment environment for acquiring the subject's biometric data and gained the subjects' METs and clo value for calculating the PMV value. The biometric data were analyzed in three regression models to predict PMV value, and MAE and RMSE evaluated each regression model. The fewest number of wearable sensors could be confirmed by gradually reducing the feature values of input data of the regression model. As a result, we acknowledged that the human thermal comfort in an indoor environment could be estimated by heart rate data and left-arm temperature data while applying the proposed method to a daily environment.},

The proposed approach is based solely on the real-time visual status of humans and assumes that the thermal-adaptive behavior of people contains a variety of information that allows for inferences about the temperature comfort of a room. To this end, we develop a technique to apply thermal-adaptive behavior recognition to thermal sensation inference based on a spatial temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN). The approach can recognize 16 thermal-adaptive behaviors, which collected from two questionnaires were conducted at Shandong Normal University, in surveillance videos in real time. Based on the collected data, we release a video dataset of thermal-adaptive behaviors and extensively evaluate the proposed approach on the newly collected thermal-adaptive behavior video benchmark. The experimental results show that the median prediction accuracy of thermal sensation is up to 78\% when all actions are considered, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.},

In the control loop, the technical feature of the human demand-oriented supply can help operate HVAC effectively. Among many technical options, real time monitoring based on feedback signals from end users has been frequently reported as a critical technology to confirm optimizing building performance. Recent studies have incorporated human thermal physiology signals and thermal comfort/discomfort status as real-time feedback signals. A series of human subject experiments used to be conducted by primarily adopting subjective questionnaire surveys in a lab-setting study, which is limited in the application for reality. With the help of advanced technologies, physiological signals have been detected, measured and processed by using multiple technical formats, such as wearable sensors. Nevertheless, they mostly require physical contacts with the skin surface in spite of the small physical dimension and compatibility with other wearable accessories, such as goggles, and intelligent bracelets. Most recently, a low cost small infrared camera has been adopted for monitoring human facial images, which could detect the facial skin temperature and blood perfusion in a contactless way. Also, according to latest pilot studies, a conventional digital camera can generate infrared images with the help of new methods, such as the Euler video magnification technology. Human thermal comfort/discomfort poses can also be detected by video methods without contacting human bodies and be analyzed by the skeleton keypoints model. In this review, new sensing technologies were summarized, their cons and pros were discussed, and extended applications for the demand-oriented ventilation were also reviewed as potential development and applications.},

The algorithm could recognize twelve thermal discomfort related human poses. These poses were derived from a questionnaire survey of 369 human subjects. Some other human subjects participated in the validation experiments of the proposed method. All twelve thermal discomfort related poses can be recognized effectively.},

In this paper, a thermal comfort detection method is developed based on frown expression and the adjusted network structure is presented. To explore the relationship between the facial expressions and thermal, we also design experiments and collect data by setting temperature as the only environmental variable. We also address the small sample size issue using the data enhancement technique. To improve the detection efficiency by focusing on the detection area, the data is preprocessed in our method to obtain a face mask. We also compare several popular neural networks and choose the best one to adjust the network structure. The experiments indicate that the recognition accuracy of the proposed system is 95.4\%.},

A wristband sensor continuously monitors physiological data (i.e. heart rate, skin temperature, and electrodermal activity). On the other hand, a thermal camera captures temperature distribution of facial parts only when a user's face is in the camera frame. When a thermal camera cannot capture the user's face, our method estimates thermal comfort based on the current features obtained by the wristband sensor and the past estimation results using the thermal camera. To investigate the effectiveness in the reduction of energy consumption by air conditioning, we evaluate our method by collecting data from 15 subjects for 128 days. The results show our method achieves F-measure of 0.85 for estimating thermal comfort allowing shifts to the neighboring classes.},

In this paper, a scheme for detecting cell-phone use that is based on deep learning is proposed, which can eliminate the potential risk by detecting the driver behavior and issuing an early warning. The proposed scheme consists of two stages: model training and practical testing. In the former, a multi-angle arrangement of cameras is first designed. Then, based on self-established data set, two independent convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are trained by optimizing the size and number of the convolution kernels, which can efficiently recognize cell-phones and hands in real time. In the testing stage, dynamic region extraction and skin color detection are employed as preprocessing to improve the accuracy of target recognition. Then, with the trained CNNs, the detection of cell-phone and hand targets is carried out, and the corresponding early warning is issued based on the distance of the interaction between the cell-phone and the hand. Numerous experiments are conducted and the results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can accurately detect cell-phone use during driving in real time, with a running time of 144 fps and an accuracy of 95.7\%.},

The survey was made to gather data that can be useful when new concepts of controlling the indoor environment are developed. The following indoor environmental conditions influencing comfort in the built environment were surveyed: thermal, visual and acoustic, as well as air quality. The literature was surveyed to determine which of these conditions were ranked by building users as being the most important determinants of comfort. The survey also examined the extent to which other factors unrelated to the indoor environment, such as individual characteristics of building occupants, building-related factors and outdoor climate including seasonal changes, influence whether the indoor environment is evaluated as comfortable or not. The results suggest that when developing systems for controlling the indoor environment, the type of building and outdoor climate, including season, should be taken into account. Providing occupants with the possibility to control the indoor environment improves thermal and visual comfort as well as satisfaction with the air quality. Thermal comfort is ranked by building occupants to be of greater importance compared with visual and acoustic comfort and good air quality. It also seems to influence to a higher degree the overall satisfaction with indoor environmental quality compared with the impact of other indoor environmental conditions.},

Emotions direct and focus people's attention on objects and situations, and affects performance, judgment and risk-taking. All of these properties are crucial for driving where the smallest slip-up can have grave repercussions. Emotional cues in a car-voice, paired with the emotional state of the driver, have been found to influence driving performance. This initiated the design of an in-car driver emotion detection and response system. Results show that the in-car system can recognise and track changes in the emotional state of the driver. This study considers older drivers who often feel both unsafe and insecure due to concerns about declining abilities and in particular vision.},

Experiments with three temperature conditions were carried out in a climate chamber during the period in winter. Twelve subjects participated in the experiments simulating moving inside and outside of rooms or cabins with air conditioning. Skin temperatures and thermal sensation were recorded. Results showed overshoot and asymmetry of TSV due to the step-change. Skin temperature changed immediately when subjects entered a new environment. When moving into a neutral environment from cool, dynamic thermal sensation was in the thermal comfort zone and overshoot was not obvious. Air-conditioning in a transitional area should be considered to limit temperature difference to not more than 5uC to decrease the unacceptability of temperature step-change. The linear relationship between thermal sensation and skin temperature or gradient of skin temperature does not apply in a stepchange environment. There is a significant linear correlation between TSV and Qloss in the transient environment. Heat loss from the human skin surface can be used to predict dynamic thermal sensation instead of the heat transfer of the whole human body.},

We assessed the feasibility of wrist skin temperature monitoring for estimating subjective thermal sensation. We invented a wrist band that simultaneously monitors skin temperatures from the wrist (i.e., the radial artery and ulnar artery regions, and upper wrist) and the fingertip. Skin temperatures from eight healthy subjects were acquired while thermal sensation varied. To develop a thermal sensation estimation model, the mean skin temperature, temperature gradient, time differential of the temperatures, and average power of frequency band were calculated. A thermal sensation estimation model using temperatures of the fingertip and wrist showed the highest accuracy (mean root mean square error [RMSE]: 1.26 {$\pm$} 0.31). An estimation model based on the three wrist skin temperatures showed a slightly better result to the model that used a single fingertip skin temperature (mean RMSE: 1.39 {$\pm$} 0.18). When a personalized thermal sensation estimation model based on three wrist skin temperatures was used, the mean RMSE was 1.06 {$\pm$} 0.29, and the correlation coefficient was 0.89.

Methods In this observational prospective study, 237 patients were recruited from the intensive care unit of Imam Ali Hospital of Kermanshah. The patients' body temperatures were measured by four peripheral methods; oral, axillary, tympanic, and forehead along with a standard central nasopharyngeal measurement. After data collection, the results were analyzed by paired t-test, kappa coefficient, receiver operating characteristic curve, and using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, version 19, software. Results There was a significant meaningful correlation between all the peripheral methods when compared with the central measurement (P{$<$}0.001). Kappa coefficients showed good agreement between the temperatures of right and left tympanic membranes and the standard central nasopharyngeal measurement (88\%). Paired t-test demonstrated an acceptable precision with forehead (P=0.132), left (P=0.18) and right (P=0.318) tympanic membranes, oral (P=1.00), and axillary (P=1.00) methods. Sensitivity and specificity of both the left and right tympanic membranes were more than for other methods. Conclusion The tympanic and forehead methods had the highest and lowest accuracy for measuring body temperature, respectively. It is recommended to use the tympanic method (right and left) for assessing a patient's body temperature in the intensive care units because of high accuracy and acceptable precision.},

Methods: Twelve healthy young (age: 23 {$\pm$} 3) male participants completed experimental trials where Ta increased from 15\textdegree{} to 40 \textdegree C (heating) and then decreased from 40 to 15 \textdegree C (cooling). In one trial (FAST), the rate of change in Ta was maintained at 1 \textdegree C.min-1, and in the other (SLOW) at 0.5 \textdegree C.min-1. During each trial participants provided ratings of TC at 3-min intervals to determine their thermal comfort zone (TCZ). Results: In the FAST trial, participants identified TCZ at an Ta between 22 {$\pm$} 4 and 30 {$\pm$} 4 \textdegree C during heating and between 25 {$\pm$} 3 and 33 {$\pm$} 3 \textdegree C during cooling phase (p=.003), and in the SLOW trial between 21 {$\pm$} 3 and 33 {$\pm$} 4 \textdegree C during heating and between 23 {$\pm$} 4 and 34 {$\pm$} 3 \textdegree C during cooling phase (p=.012). During the heating phase TCZ was established at a lower range of Ta, compared to cooling phase. The difference between the heating and cooling phases in preferred range of Ta was more pronounced in the FAST compared to SLOW trial. Conclusion: TCZ is influenced not only by the prevailing temperature, but also by the direction and the rate of the change in Ta. Faster changes in Ta (1 \textdegree C.min-1) established the TCZ at a higher Ta during cooling and at a lower Ta during heating phase.},

We placed intracranial monitors in a series of consecutive patients hospitalized for cardiac arrest at a single tertiary care facility within 12 hours of return of spontaneous circulation to guide postcardiac arrest care. We compared the absolute difference between brain and core (esophageal or rectal) temperature measurements every hour for the duration of intracranial monitoring and tested for a lag between brain and core temperature using the average square difference method. Overall, 11 patients underwent simultaneous brain and core temperature monitoring for a total of 906 hours of data (Median 95; IQR: 15\textendash 118 hours per subject). On average, brain temperature was 0.34C\textdegree{} (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.31\textendash 0.37) higher than core temperature. In 7\% of observations, brain temperature exceeded the measured core temperature {$\geq$}1\textdegree C.

One of the predictions of the adaptive hypothesis is that people in warm climate zones prefer warmer indoor temperatures than people living in cold climate zones. This is contrary to the static assumptions underlying the current ASHRAE comfort standard 55-92. To examine the adaptive hypothesis and its implications for Standard 55-92, the ASHRAE RP-884 project assembled a quality-controlled database from thermal comfort field experiments worldwide (circa 21,000 observations from 160 buildings). Our statistical analysis examined the semantics of thermal comfort in terms of thermal sensation, acceptability, and preference, as a function of both indoor and outdoor temperature. Optimum indoor temperatures tracked both prevailing indoor and outdoor temperatures, as predicted by the adaptive hypothesis. The static predicted mean vote (PMV) model was shown to be partially adaptive by accounting for behavioral adjustments, and fully explained adaptation occurring in HVAC buildings. Occupants in naturally ventilated buildings were tolerant of a significantly wider range of temperatures, explained by a combination of both behavioral adjustment and psychological adaptation. These results formed the basis of a proposal for a variable indoor temperature standard.},

There is a significant linear correlation between TSV and Qloss in the transient environment. Heat loss from the human skin surface can be used to predict dynamic thermal sensation instead of the heat transfer of the whole human body.},

Available comfort models are already used to correlate comfort to influencing factors. However, the available models do not fully account for specific influences as scent, ambient light and thermal radiation. To obtain a deeper understanding regarding thermal sensation, these specific influencing factors were examined in two user studies in two climate chambers. The first study used scent and light as independent variables while the second study varied the type of thermal radiation. The results reveal significant impact of the independent variables on the subjective perception and are therefore suggested for integration into future thermal comfort models.},

Insulation values varied over manikins, which is attributed to their different shapes and the different fit of the clothing. The mean value over three manikins is reported (with standard deviation) to include this potential real-life variation in the results. The relation of the clothing surface area factor to intrinsic clothing insulation was found to be different from that published for Western clothing. Prediction equations for the clothing surface area factor fcl based on the new data had only limited predictive power, which, however, was also the case for those obtained in the past for Western clothing. This issue seems to be commonly overlooked, as the use of these prediction equations is widespread. It has to be concluded that reliable fcl values can only be obtained when they are actually measured, as in the present work. However, we suggest that the concept of the fcl factor for the non-Western clothing may not be appropriate and may require further attention in research, as wide-falling-robes and gowns do not match the cylindrical clothing and air layer model on which the fcl concept is based. In summary, the results provide an extensive database of insulation values of non-Western clothing that is expected to be a valuable addition to ASHRAE Standard 55-2013 (ASHRAE 2013a), ISO Standard 7730-2005 (ISO 2005), and ISO Standard 9920-2009 (ISO 2009).

The program Malchaire\_interpretation\_charge \_travail\_FC.exe available via my repertory DROPBOX follows the procedure of level 3, Analyze. 1 Scope The metabolic rate, as a conversion of chemical into mechanical and thermal energy, measures the energetic cost of muscular load and gives a numerical index of activity. Metabolic rate is an important determinant of the comfort or the strain resulting from exposure to a thermal environment. In particular, in hot climates, the high levels of metabolic heat production associated with muscular work aggravate heat stress, as large amounts of heat need to be dissipated, mostly by sweat evaporation. This International Standard specifies different methods for the determination of metabolic rate in the context of ergonomics of the climatic working environment. It can also be used for other applications \textemdash{} for example, the assessment of working practices, the energetic cost of specific jobs or sport activities, the total cost of an activity, etc. The estimations, tables and other data included in this International Standard concern an " average " individual: \textbullet{} a man 30 years old weighing 70 kg and 1,75 m tall (body surface area 1,8 m 2); \textbullet{} a woman 30 years old weighing 60 kg and 1,70 m tall (body surface area 1,6 m 2).

The present study examined whether such regional differences were also evident in the perception of thermal comfort. Methods Regional thermal comfort was assessed in males (N=8) and females (N=8), by having them regulate the temperature of the water delivered to a water-perfused suit (WPS), within a temperature range considered thermally comfortable. In separate trials, subjects regulated the temperature of the WPS, or specific regions of the suit covering different skin areas (arms, legs, front torso and back torso). In the absence of subjective temperature regulation (TR), the temperature changed in a sinusoidal manner from 10\textdegree C to 50\textdegree C; by depressing a switch and reversing the direction of the temperature at the limits of the thermal comfort zone (TCZ), each subject defined TCZ for each body region investigated. Results The range of regulated temperatures did not differ between genders and skin regions. Local Tsk at the lower and upper limits of the TCZ was similar for both genders. Higher (p\textexclamdown 0.05) local Tsk was preferred for the arms (35.4{$\pm$}2.1\textdegree C), compared to other regions (legs: 34.4{$\pm$}5.4\textdegree C, front torso: 34.6{$\pm$}2.8\textdegree C, 34.3{$\pm$}6.6\textdegree C), irrespective of gender. Conclusions In thermally comfortable conditions, the well-established regional differences in thermosensitivity are not reflected in the TCZ, with similar temperature preferences by both genders. Thermal comfort of different skin regions and overall body is not achieved at a single skin temperature, but at range of temperatures, defined as the TCZ.},

  abstract = {Since the thermal condition of living spaces affects the occupants' productivity and their quality of life, it is important to design effective heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) control strategies for better energy efficiency and thermal comfort. An essential step in HVAC control and energy optimization is thermal comfort modeling. Recently, data-driven thermal comfort models have been preferred over the Fanger's Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model due to higher accuracy and ease of use. However, the unavailability of comprehensive labelled thermal comfort data from the occupants poses a significant modeling challenge. This paper addresses data inadequacy issues by adopting `transfer learning' to leverage well learned knowledge from source domain (same climate zones) to target domain (different climate zone) where modeling data is sparse. Specifically, a Transfer Learning based Convolutional Neural Networks-Long Short Term Memory neural networks (TL CNN-LSTM) is designed for effective thermal comfort modeling that exploits the spatio-temporal relations in the thermal comfort data. The significant modeling parameters for TL CNN-LSTM are identified using the Chi-squared test. Further, the lack of sufficient samples across all thermal conditions in the available thermal comfort datasets was handled by Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). Experiments with two source (ASHRAE RP-884 and Scales Project) and one target (Medium US office) datasets demonstrate the ability of TL CNN-LSTM in achieving an accuracy of {$>$}55\% with limited data in target buildings. The limitation of TL CNN-LSTM is its continued dependence on intrusive parameters and the challenges in assessing its adaptability to different climate zones.},

  abstract = {The adaptive hypothesis predicts that contextual factors and past thermal history modify building occupants' thermal expectations and preferences. One of the predictions of the adaptive hypothesis is that people in warm climate zones prefer warmer indoor temperatures than people living in cold climate zones. This is contrary to the static assumptions underlying the current ASHRAE comfort standard 55-92. To examine the adaptive hypothesis and its implications for Standard 55-92, the ASHRAE RP-884 project assembled a quality-controlled database from thermal comfort field experiments worldwide (circa 21,000 observations from 160 buildings). Our statistical analysis examined the semantics of thermal comfort in terms of thermal sensation, acceptability, and preference, as a function of both indoor and outdoor temperature. Optimum indoor temperatures tracked both prevailing indoor and outdoor temperatures, as predicted by the adaptive hypothesis. The static predicted means vote (PMV) model was shown to be partially adaptive by accounting for behavioral adjustments, and fully explained adaptation occurring in HVAC buildings. Occupants in naturally ventilated buildings were tolerant of a significantly wider range of temperatures, explained by a combination of both behavioral adjustment and psychological adaptation. These results formed the basis of a proposal for a variable indoor temperature standard.},

For example, pythermalcomfort can be used to calculate: whole body thermal comfort indices (e.g., Predicted Mean Vote, adaptive models, Standard Equivalent Temperature), local discomfort, clothing insulation, and psychrometric properties of air. All pythermalcomfort functions have been validated against the reference tables provided in the corresponding thermal comfort standards. We have developed documentation, examples and tutorial videos to guide users on how to use our package. pythermalcomfort allows researchers and professionals to accurately perform complex thermal comfort calculations without the need of re-writing the programming code. With Python being among the most widely utilized programming languages and pythermalcomfort being the only Python library which includes a comprehensive list of thermal comfort functions, we believe that pythermalcomfort will have a significant impact on both the research and industrial communities.},

The exercise began with a systematic collection and harmonization of raw data from the last two decades of thermal comfort field studies around the world. The ASHRAE Global Thermal Comfort Database II (Comfort Database), now an online, open-source database, includes approximately 81,846 complete sets of objective indoor climatic observations with accompanying ``right-here-right-now'' subjective evaluations by the building occupants who were exposed to them. The database is intended to support diverse inquiries about thermal comfort in field settings. A simple web-based interface to the database enables filtering on multiple criteria, including building typology, occupancy type, subjects' demographic variables, subjective thermal comfort states, indoor thermal environmental criteria, calculated comfort indices, environmental control criteria and outdoor meteorological information. Furthermore, a web-based interactive thermal comfort visualization tool has been developed that allows end-users to quickly and interactively explore the data.},

Current thermal comfort standards, catering to the normal weight occupant, may hence be ignoring nearly 60\% of the population. This could have significant comfort, productivity and energy implications. We performed a climate chamber study of the thermal response of 76 subjects in all the body mass index (BMI) categories, from 17 and 37 kg/m2. Every participant underwent the same four sessions at average operative temperatures of 19.9, 22.4, 25.3, and 28.2 \textdegree C. We obtained subjective feedback from participants on their thermal sensation and preference, humidity sensation and preference, thermal comfort rating, and air quality perception. We also measured skin temperature, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood glucose level, weight, height, waist and hip circumferences and body composition. Overall, we did not find significant impact of BMI on the thermal sensation. However, the overweight and obese participants preferred lower temperature compared to normal weight and underweight participants which may indicate practical implication for control strategies.},

In this paper, we propose a novel action recognition method by processing the video data using convolutional neural network (CNN) and deep bidirectional LSTM (DB-LSTM) network. First, deep features are extracted from every sixth frame of the videos, which helps reduce the redundancy and complexity. Next, the sequential information among frame features is learnt using DB-LSTM network, where multiple layers are stacked together in both forward pass and backward pass of DB-LSTM to increase its depth. The proposed method is capable of learning long term sequences and can process lengthy videos by analyzing features for a certain time interval. Experimental results show significant improvements in action recognition using the proposed method on three benchmark data sets including UCF-101, YouTube 11 Actions, and HMDB51 compared with the state-of-the-art action recognition methods.},

All knowledge\textemdash beyond that of bare isolated occurrence\textemdash deals with uniformities. Of the latter, some few have a claim to be considered absolute, such as mathematical implications and mechanical laws. But the vast majority are only partial; medicine does not teach that smallpox is inevitably escaped by vaccination, but that it is so generally; biology has not shown that all animals require organic food, but that nearly all do so; in daily life, a dark sky is no proof that it will rain, but merely a warning; even in morality, the sole categorical imperative alleged by Kant was the sinfulness of telling a lie, and few thinkers since have admitted so much as this to be valid universally. In psychology, more perhaps than in any other science, it is hard to find absolutely inflexible coincidences; occasionally, indeed, there appear uniformities sufficiently regular to be practically treated as laws, but infinitely the greater part of the observations hitherto recorded concern only more or less pronounced tendencies of one event or attribute to accompany another. Under these circumstances, one might well have expected that the evidential evaluation and precise mensuration of tendencies had long been the subject of exhaustive investigation and now formed one of the earliest sections in a beginner's psychological course. Instead, we find only a general na{\"\i}ve ignorance that there is anything about it requiring to be learnt. One after another, laborious series of experiments are executed and published with the purpose of demonstrating some connection between two events, wherein the otherwise learned psychologist reveals that his art of proving and measuring correspondence has not advanced beyond that of lay persons. The consequence has been that the significance of the experiments is not at all rightly understood, nor have any definite facts been elicited that may be either confirmed or refuted. The present article is a commencement at attempting to remedy this deficiency of scientific correlation. With this view, it will be strictly confined to the needs of practical workers, and all theoretical mathematical demonstrations will be omitted; it may, however, be said that the relations stated have already received a large amount of empirical verification. Great thanks are due from me to Professor Haussdorff and to Dr. G. Lipps, each of whom have supplied a useful theorem in polynomial probability; the former has also very kindly given valuable advice concerning the proof of the important formul\ae{} for elimination of ``systematic deviations.'' At the same time, and for the same reason, the meaning and working of the various formul\ae{} have been explained sufficiently, it is hoped, to render them readily usable even by those whose knowledge of mathematics is elementary. The fundamental procedure is accompanied by simple imaginary examples, while the more advanced parts are illustrated by cases that have actually occurred in my personal experience. For more abundant and positive exemplification, the reader is requested to refer to the under cited research, which is entirely built upon the principles and mathematical relations here laid down. In conclusion, the general value of the methodics recommended is emphasized by a brief criticism of the best correlational work hitherto made public, and also the important question is discussed as to the number of ``cases'' required for an experimental series.},

The odour intensity of air did not change significantly with temperature and humidity; however, a strong and significant impact of temperature and humidity on the perception of air quality was found. The air was perceived as less acceptable with increasing temperature and humidity. This impact decreased with an increasing level of air pollution. Significant linear correlations were found between acceptability and enthalpy of the air at all pollution levels tested, and a linear model was established to describe the dependence of perceived air quality on temperature and humidity at different pollution levels.},

Ten male subjects were exposed to mean air velocities increased step-by-step ranging from 0.05 m {$\cdot$} s-1 to 0.40 m {$\cdot$} s-1 at air temperatures of 11, 14, 17 and 20\textdegree C, while performing standing physical work at two different activity levels (104 W {$\cdot$} m- and 129 W {$\cdot$} m-2). The subjects were asked whether they could feel an air movement, whether it was uncomfortable and where it was felt. The neck was identified as the most draught sensitive area, and draught was most often felt at the head region comprising neck, face and upper back. At the uncovered regions of the hands and face an influence of air temperature on local draught ratings was seen whereas the percentage of dissatisfied due to draught at the head region did not depend on the air temperature. The results showed that working at a high activity level resulted in fewer dissatisfied due to draught, as compared to a low activity level. It was concluded that the metabolic rate, equivalent to the internal heat production, significantly influenced human response to air movements for standing activity in a cool environment.},

  abstract = {Machine and deep learning-based algorithms are the emerging approaches in addressing prediction problems in time series. These techniques have been shown to produce more accurate results than conventional regression-based modeling. It has been reported that artificial Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with memory, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), are superior compared to Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with a large margin. The LSTM-based models incorporate additional ``gates'' for the purpose of memorizing longer sequences of input data. The major question is that whether the gates incorporated in the LSTM architecture already offers a good prediction and whether additional training of data would be necessary to further improve the prediction. Bidirectional LSTMs (BiLSTMs) enable additional training by traversing the input data twice (i.e., 1) left-to-right, and 2) right-to-left). The research question of interest is then whether BiLSTM, with additional training capability, outperforms regular unidirectional LSTM. This paper reports a behavioral analysis and comparison of BiLSTM and LSTM models. The objective is to explore to what extend additional layers of training of data would be beneficial to tune the involved parameters. The results show that additional training of data and thus BiLSTM-based modeling offers better predictions than regular LSTM-based models. More specifically, it was observed that BiLSTM models provide better predictions compared to ARIMA and LSTM models. It was also observed that BiLSTM models reach the equilibrium much slower than LSTM-based models.},

Although both core (Tc) and skin-surface (Tsk) temperatures are known afferent inputs to the thermoregulatory system, the relative contributions of Tc and Tsk to thermal comfort are unknown. We independently altered Tc and Tsk in human subjects while measuring thermal comfort, vasomotor changes, metabolic heat production, and systemic catecholaminergic responses. Multiple linear regression was used to determine the relative Tc/Tskcontribution to thermal comfort and the autonomic thermoregulatory responses, by using the ratio of regression coefficients for Tc and Tsk. The Tc/Tskcontribution ratio was relatively lower for thermal comfort (1:1) than for vasomotor changes (3:1; P = 0.008), metabolic heat production (3.6:1;P = 0.001), norepinephrine (1.8:1;P = 0.03), and epinephrine (3:1;P = 0.006) responses. Thus Tc and Tsk contribute about equally toward thermal comfort, whereas Tcpredominates in regulation of the autonomic and metabolic responses. }

  abstract = {The wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) index is used in industry, sports and other areas to indicate the heat stress level for humans and animals. One of the values needed to calculate the WBGT Index is the black globe temperature. The black globe temperature is measured using a Black Globe Temperature Sensor which includes a black globe with a thermometer inserted in the center. However, the Black Globe Temperature Sensor can be costly and many of these instruments may be needed to get measurements in many locations. The lead author has derived a formula to estimate the black globe temperature using readily available data collected by the National Weather Service (NWS). The formula was derived from a formula suggested by Kuehn [7], which was based on heat transfer theory. The resulting equation was a fourth degree polynomial in terms of the black globe temperature. It was determined that the black globe temperature can be very accurately approximated by taking a fourth degree polynomial in terms of the black globe temperature to create a linear approximation for black globe temperature. Some preliminary tests indicate accuracy within 0.5\r{}F.},

Conventional wisdom attributes small generalization error either to properties of the model family, or to the regularization techniques used during training. Through extensive systematic experiments, we show how these traditional approaches fail to explain why large neural networks generalize well in practice. Specifically, our experiments establish that state-of-the-art convolutional networks for image classification trained with stochastic gradient methods easily fit a random labeling of the training data. This phenomenon is qualitatively unaffected by explicit regularization, and occurs even if we replace the true images by completely unstructured random noise. We corroborate these experimental findings with a theoretical construction showing that simple depth two neural networks already have perfect finite sample expressivity as soon as the number of parameters exceeds the number of data points as it usually does in practice. We interpret our experimental findings by comparison with traditional models.},

Because of the presence of noise, the limited size of training set, and the complexity of classifiers, overfitting happens. This paper is going to talk about overfitting from the perspectives of causes and solutions. To reduce the effects of overfitting, various strategies are proposed to address to these causes: 1) ``early-stopping'' strategy is introduced to prevent overfitting by stopping training before the performance stops optimize; 2) ``network-reduction'' strategy is used to exclude the noises in training set; 3) ``data-expansion'' strategy is proposed for complicated models to fine-tune the hyper-parameters sets with a great amount of data; and 4) ``regularization'' strategy is proposed to guarantee models performance to a great extent while dealing with real world issues by feature-selection, and by distinguishing more useful and less useful features.},

Among these requirements, thermal comfort is an important design criterion for indoor environmental quality that affects patients' healing processes and the wellbeing of medical staff. The patients' thermal comfort is given priority due to their medical conditions and impaired immune systems. Thermal comfort and related contexts have been well-covered in many research articles; however, the number of review articles is limited. This article aims to conduct a holistic and critical review of existing studies offering insights on future research trends (180 articles were analyzed). The key research themes are identified using scientometric analysis. Focus is on influencing factors, field-surveys, improving measures and energy saving related to thermal comfort. The primary outcome concludes that ventilation systems play a key role in maintaining acceptable, thermally-comfortable conditions for patients and medical staff. It is also found that acceptable thermal comfort is highly case-dependent and varies substantially based on the health condition of the patient as well as the type and level of staff activities. The measures currently mentioned to minimize energy consumption are also discussed. Some interesting issues, including the inaccuracy arising from the use of predicted mean vote (PMV) and the impact of gender, age, and related factors on thermal comfort, have been noted.

  abstract = {Thermal comfort is defined as the condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment and it is assessed by subjective evaluation. Achieving comfortable environments is essential for human health, productivity, learning performance and energy efficiency. The measurement of thermal comfort requires an indirect process involving several domains: thermal environment, physiology and psychology. Four physiological signals were reviewed, considering their relevance in the context of measuring indoor thermal comfort. The measurement approaches for investigating electroencephalography, electrocardiograph, skin temperature and galvanic skin response signals in the field of thermal comfort are presented. This paper introduces an overview on the application of wearable sensors for recording physiological parameters and extracting features potentially correlated with thermal comfort, together with a discussion about their reliability. The review shows the state of the art, the identification of existing knowledge gaps in this area and the corresponding needs for future research and dedicated methodological efforts.},

  abstract = {The conventional approach to thermal environment design is concerned with delivery and distribution of the air inside the spaces rather than designing the airflow patterns to provide comfort in the occupied zone. Air has a relatively low heat capacity and using airflow solely for its energy carrying capacity, and not for its dynamic properties, underutilizes this medium as a thermal comfort factor. However, there is increasing evidence that airflow around the human body provides thermal comfort even in cool temperatures and varying airflow is more effective in providing a cooling sensation than the constant airflow. A human subject test was designed to study the cooling effectiveness of dynamic airflow conditions which was directed to the head, hands and the feet of the people for neutral (23.9\textdegree C) and warm (28.3\textdegree C) ambient temperatures as well as sedentary (1.2Met) and high metabolic rate (4Met) conditions. The concept of Dynamic Localized Airflow was introduced. Results showed that most subjects were either satisfied with the increased airflow speeds or preferred more airflow in all conditions. Airflow preference did not differ for neutral and warm room temperatures. The 30-s pulsed airflow was more effective in providing a cooling sensation than constant airflow and 60-s pulsed airflow. In addition, the simultaneous head/hands/feet airflow was more effective in providing cooling sensation that the head only airflow. It was concluded at the end of the study that people can tolerate warm room temperatures even in high metabolic conditions provided that airflow is present with a certain pattern around them.},

An optimal level of the thermal comfort inside a vehicle can only be achieved by taking into account these measurable and personal factors. Based on these factors we can calculate Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) which represents the average thermal sensation felt by a group of people placed in the vehicle and determining the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) index, which is the quantitative measure of thermal comfort of a group of people at a particular environment.},

  abstract = {Electric power forecasting plays a substantial role in the administration and balance of current power systems. For this reason, accurate predictions of service demands are needed to develop better programming for the generation and distribution of power and to reduce the risk of vulnerabilities in the integration of an electric power system. For the purposes of the current study, a systematic literature review was applied to identify the type of model that has the highest propensity to show precision in the context of electric power forecasting. The state-of-the-art model in accurate electric power forecasting was determined from the results reported in 257 accuracy tests from five geographic regions. Two classes of forecasting models were compared: classical statistical or mathematical (MSC) and machine learning (ML) models. Furthermore, the use of hybrid models that have made significant contributions to electric power forecasting is identified, and a case of study is applied to demonstrate its good performance when compared with traditional models. Among our main findings, we conclude that forecasting errors are minimized by reducing the time horizon, that ML models that consider various sources of exogenous variability tend to have better forecast accuracy, and finally, that the accuracy of the forecasting models has significantly increased over the last five years.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The present study compared the thermal comfort zones (TCZ) of the hands, feet and head in eight male and eight female participants, assessed with water-perfused segments (WPS). METHODS: On separate occasions, and separated by a minimum of one day, participants were requested to regulate the temperature of three distal skin regions (hands, feet and head) within their TCZ. On each occasion they donned a specific water-perfused segment (WPS), either gloves, socks or hood for assessing the TCZ of the hands, feet and head, respectively. In the absence of regulation, the temperature of the water perfusing the WPS changed in a saw-tooth manner from 10 to 50\textdegree C; by depressing a switch and reversing the direction of the temperature at the limits of the TCZ, each participant defined the TCZ for each skin region investigated. RESULTS: The range of regulated temperatures (upper and lower limits of the TCZ) did not differ between studied skin regions or between genders. Participants however maintained higher head (35.7{$\pm$}0.4\textdegree C; p˂0.001) skin temperature (Tsk) compared to hands (34.5{$\pm$}0.8\textdegree C) and feet (33.8{$\pm$}1.1\textdegree C). CONCLUSIONS: When exposed to normothermic conditions, distal skin regions do not differ in ranges of temperatures, perceived as thermally comfortable.},

For the segment-wise thermal interactions between human body and its surrounding, simulations have been conducted by appropriately modifying Gagge 2-node model to multi-segment case to demonstrate the local differences. Simulation results are found to be in good agreement with experimental and simulation results reported in the literature. To calculate the interior surface temperatures of the wall and ceiling, the sol\textendash air temperature approach is used for convenience. It is shown in the paper that the body segments close the relatively hot surfaces are more affected than others and interior surface temperatures of un-insulated walls and ceilings exposed to a strong solar radiation reach high levels, all of which cause thermal discomfort for the occupants in buildings.},

Three physiological parameters, including skin temperature (local and mean), electrocardiograph (ECG) and electroencephalogram (EEG), were investigated to see how they responded to the ambient temperature and how they were related to the thermal comfort sensation. A total of four ambient temperatures (21 \textdegree C, 24 \textdegree C, 26 \textdegree C and 29 \textdegree C) were created, while the other thermal conditions including the air velocity (about 0.05{$\pm$}0.01 m/s) and the air humidity (about 60{$\pm$}5 m/s) were kept as stable as possible throughout the experiments. Twenty healthy students were tested with questionnaire investigation under those thermal environments. The statistical analysis shows that the skin temperature (local and mean), the ratio of LFnorm to HFnorm of ECG and the global relative power of the different EEG frequency bands will be sensitive to the ambient temperatures and the thermal sensations of the subjects. It is suggested that the three physiological parameters should be considered all together in the future study of thermal comfort.},

  abstract = {Undoubtedly, adjusting our thermoregulatory behavior represents the most effective mechanism to maintain thermal homeostasis and ensure survival in the diverse thermal environments that we face on this planet. Remarkably, our thermal behavior is entirely dependent on the ability to detect variations in our internal (i.e. body) and external environment, via sensing changes in skin temperature and wetness. In the past 30 years, we have seen a significant expansion of our understanding of the molecular, neuroanatomical and neurophysiological mechanisms that allow humans to sense temperature and humidity. The discovery of temperature-activated ion channels which gate the generation of action potentials in thermosensitive neurons, along with the characterization of the spino-thalamo-cortical thermosensory pathway, and the development of neural models for the perception of skin wetness, are only some of the recent advances which have provided incredible insights on how biophysical changes in skin temperature and wetness are transduced into those neural signals which constitute the physiological substrate of skin thermal and wetness sensations. Understanding how afferent thermal inputs are integrated and how these contribute to behavioral and autonomic thermoregulatory responses under normal brain function is critical to determine how these mechanisms are disrupted in those neurological conditions which see the concurrent presence of afferent thermosensory abnormalities and efferent thermoregulatory dysfunctions. Furthermore, advancing the knowledge on skin thermal and wetness sensations is crucial to support the development of neuro-prosthetics. In light of the above, this review will focus on the peripheral and central neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning skin thermal and wetness sensations in humans.},

abstract = {Thermal comfort is a decisive factor for the well-being, productivity, and overall satisfaction of commercial building occupants. Many commercial building automation systems either use a fixed zone-wide temperature set-point for all occupants or they rely on extensive sensor deployments with frequent online interaction with occupants. This results in inadequate comfort levels or significant training effort from users, respectively. However, the increasing ubiquity of cheap, depth-based occupancy tracking systems has enabled an improvement in inferential capabilities. We propose the novel system OccuTherm to model thermal comfort of occupants. We conducted a laboratory study with 77 participants to collect data for the implementation of a thermal comfort model that derives thermal comfort using the human body shape. Based on the comparison with model baselines and ablations, we show that our approach infers thermal comfort of individuals with 60\% accuracy when body shape information is taken into account; 6\% more than state-of-the-art approaches. We make our code, mobile app, datasets, and models freely available.},

abstract = {Cohort Comfort Models (CCM) are introduced as a technique for creating a personalized thermal prediction for a new building occupant without the need to collect large amounts of individual comfort-related data. This approach leverages historical data collected from a sample population, who have some underlying preference similarity to the new occupant. The method uses background information such as physical and demographic characteristics and one-time onboarding surveys (satisfaction with life scale, highly sensitive person scale, personality traits) from the new occupant, as well as physiological and environmental sensor measurements paired with a few thermal preference responses. The framework was implemented using two personal comfort datasets containing longitudinal data from 55 people. The datasets comprise more than 6000 unique right-here-right-now thermal comfort surveys. The results show that a CCM that uses only the one-time onboarding survey information of an individual occupant has generally as good or better performance as compared to conventional general-purpose models, but uses no historical longitudinal data as compared to personalized models. If up to ten historical personal preference data points are used, CCM increased the thermal preference prediction by 8% on average and up to 36% for half of the occupants in the first of the tested datasets. In the second dataset, one-third of the occupants increased their thermal preference prediction by 5% on average and up to 46%. CCM can be an important step toward the development of personalized thermal comfort models without the need to collect a large number of datapoints per person.}

abstract = {Understanding drivers’ states is essential for providing personalized interventions and adaptive feedback in vehicles, thereby ensuring safer driving and a more comfortable driver experience. As driving tasks necessitate understanding and reaction to the rapidly changing road environment and successful management of working memory to prevent dual-task interference, driver situation awareness (SA) should be primarily considered for such interventions and feedback. However, due to its complex nature, most of the current methods for measuring SA rely on questionnaires. In this work, we aim to develop sensor-based assessments of driver SA, especially towards road signs, which play an important role in immediate decision-making during driving. We collected eye-tracking data and physiological responses from 32 participants during simulated driving and annotated this data according to the levels of SA that drivers achieved. Our ensemble-based machine learning model that uses physiological measures and gaze-related features demonstrated an accuracy of 78.02\% in a three-class driver SA prediction. Since SA is a key component in evaluating vehicular interfaces, our VR-based approach holds the potential for the iterative design of in-car infotainment applications and road environments. The method also lays a foundation for SA-adaptive cooperation between human drivers and AI in the context of advanced driver assistance.},

abstract = {It is the purpose of this study to investigate thermal sensation (TS) and thermal comfort (TC) in changing environments. Therefore, 10 subjects stayed in a 30°C, 50% relative humidity for 30min in summer clothes and then moved to a 20°C room where they remained seated for 30min (Hot to Reference - HR). Similarly, 11 subjects moved from a 10°C, 50% relative humidity to a 20°C environment (Cold to Reference – CR) dressed in winter garments. TS (9 point scale from −4 (very cold) to +4 (very hot)) decreased from 1.5±0.4 (mean±SD) to −0.8±0.8 for HR and increased from −1.7±1.4 to 0.8±0.9 for CR. TC (5 point scale from 0 (comfortable) to +4 (extremely uncomfortable)) dropped from 1.5±0.5 to 1.2±0.4 for HR and from 1.9±0.7 to 1.3±0.4 for CR. The difference in TS between HR and CR at the end of period in 20°C illustrates the considerable dependence of thermal sensation on exposure history. It is therefore recommended to increase room temperature when it is hot outside and decrease room temperature when it is cold outside in order to maintain a neutral thermal sensation.}

abstract = {Thermal comfort affects the well-being, productivity, and overall satisfaction of building occupants. However, due to economical and practical limitations, the number of longitudinal studies that have been conducted is limited, and only a few of these studies have shared their data publicly. Longitudinal datasets collected indoors are a valuable resource to better understand how people perceive their environment. Moreover, they provide a more realistic scenario to those conducted in thermal chambers. Our objective was to share publicly a longitudinal dataset comprising data collected over a 4-week long experiment. A total of 17 participants completed thermal preferences surveys which accounted for a total of approximately 1400 unique responses across indoor and outdoor 17 spaces. For the whole duration of the study, we monitored environmental variables (e.g., temperature and relative humidity) throughout 3 buildings. Participants completed comfort surveys from the screen of their smartwatches using an open-source application named Cozie. Their indoor location was continuously monitored using a custom-designed smartphone application. Location data were used to time and spatially align environmental measurements to thermal preference responses provided by the participants. Background information of participants, such as physical characteristics and personality traits (satisfaction with life scale, highly sensitive person scale, the Big Five personality traits), was collected using an on-boarding survey administered at the beginning of the experiment. The dataset is available at https://zenodo.org/record/5502441#.YT7xyaARUTs.},

While in-vehicle interaction can utilize numerous promising modalities, no existing overview includes an extensive set of human sensors and actuators and interaction locations throughout the vehicle interior. We conducted a systematic literature review of 327 publications leading to a design space for in-vehicle interaction that outlines existing and lack of work regarding input and output modalities, locations, and multimodal interaction. To investigate user acceptance of possible modalities and locations inferred from existing work and gaps unveiled in our design space, we conducted an online study (N=48). The study revealed users' general acceptance of novel modalities (e.g., brain or thermal activity) and interaction with locations other than the front (e.g., seat or table). Our work helps practitioners evaluate key design decisions, exploit trends, and explore new areas in the domain of in-vehicle interaction.},

abstract = {Abstract View quality measures compute scores for given views and are used to determine an optimal view in viewpoint selection tasks. Unfortunately, despite the wide adoption of these measures, they are rather based on computational quantities, such as entropy, than human preferences. To instead tailor viewpoint measures towards humans, view quality measures need to be able to capture human viewpoint preferences. Therefore, we introduce a large-scale crowdsourced data set, which contains 58k annotated viewpoints for 3220 ModelNet40 models. Based on this data, we derive a neural view quality measure abiding to human preferences. We further demonstrate that this view quality measure not only generalizes to models unseen during training, but also to unseen model categories. We are thus able to predict view qualities for single images, and directly predict human preferred viewpoints for 3D models by exploiting point-based learning technology, without requiring to generate intermediate images or sampling the view sphere. We will detail our data collection procedure, describe the data analysis and model training and will evaluate the predictive quality of our trained viewpoint measure on unseen models and categories. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning approach to predict a view quality measure solely based on human preferences.},

abstract={The fast-changing and asymmetrical nature of the cabin environment challenges climate control systems in maintaining occupant comfort. This article examines the relationship between the control that occupants have over the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system and their perceived comfort within the surrounding thermal environment. Three test cases using automatic control (20°C, 22°C, 24°C) and one in manual mode were evaluated via driving trials under normal road conditions in the United Kingdom during winter. In these trials, car cabin occupants felt more comfortable when using manual control than automatic (Fisher’s test, p = 2.2 × 10−16). Occupants felt neutral thermal sensations at head and foot level when using manual control. At chest level, occupants felt thermally neutral for both automatic and manual controls. This research highlights the need for further exploration of the interaction of the cabin occupants with their HVAC systems and the impact it has on their comfort perception.}
