title = {Better Group Behaviors in Complex Environments Using Global Roadmaps},
year = {2002},
abstract = {While many methods to simulate flocking behaviors have been proposed, these techniques
usually only provide simplistic navigation and planning capabilities because each
flock member's behavior depends only on its local environment. In this work, we investigate
how the addition of global information in the form of a roadmap of the environment
enables more sophisticated flocking behaviors and supports global navigation and planning.
In this paper, we propose new techniques for four distinct group behaviors: homing,
goal searching, traversing narrow areas and shepherding. Extending ideas from cognitive
modeling, we embed behavior rules in individual flock members and in the roadmap.
These embedded behaviors enable the creatures to modify their actions based on their
current location and state. For example, the flock might move as an unordered group
in open regions and in a follow-the-leader fashion through narrow passages. These
behaviors exploit global knowledge of the environment and utilize information gathered
by all flock members which is communicated by allowing individual flock members to
dynamically update the shared roadmap to reflect (un)desirable routes or regions.
We present experimental results showing how the judicious use of simple roadmaps of
the environment enables complex behaviors to be obtained at minimal cost. Animations
can be viewed at http://parasol.tamu.edu.},

abstract = {We present a novel algorithm for navigating a large number of independent agents in
complex and dynamic environments. We compute adaptive roadmaps to perform global path
planning for each agent simultaneously. We take into account dynamic obstacles and
inter-agents interaction forces to continuously update the roadmap by using a physically-based
agent dynamics simulator. We also introduce the notion of 'link bands' for resolving
collisions among multiple agents. We present efficient techniques to compute the guiding
path forces and perform lazy updates to the roadmap. In practice, our algorithm can
perform real-time navigation of hundreds and thousands of human agents in indoor and
outdoor scenes.},

    abstract = { Motion planning for constrained systems is a version of the motion planning problem in which the motion of a robot is limited by constraints. For example, one can require that a humanoid robot such as a PR2 remain upright by constraining its torso to be above its base or require that an object such as a bucket of water remain upright by constraining the vertices of the object to be parallel to the robot’s base. Grasping can be modeled by requiring that the end effectors of the robot be located at specified handle positions. Constraints might require that the robot remain in contact with a surface, or that certain joints of the robot remain in contact with each other (e.g., closed chains). Such problems are particularly difficult because the constraints form a manifold in C-space, and planning must be restricted to this manifold. High-degree-of-freedom motion planning and motion planning for constrained systems has applications in parallel robotics, grasping and manipulation, computational biology and molecular simulations, and animation. We introduce a new concept, reachable volumes, that are a geometric representation of the regions the joints and end effectors of a robot can reach, and use it to define a new planning space called RV-space where all points automatically satisfy a problem’s constraints. Visualizations of reachable volumes can enable operators to see the regions of workspace that different parts of the robot can reach. Samples and paths generated in RV-space naturally conform to constraints, making planning for constrained systems no more difficult than planning for unconstrained systems. Consequently, constrained motion planning problems that were previously difficult or unsolvable become manageable and in many cases trivial. We introduce tools and techniques to extend the state-of-the-art sampling-based motion planning algorithms to RV-space. We define a reachable volumes sampler, a reachable volumes local planner, and a reachable volumes distance metric. We showcase the effectiveness of RV-space by applying these tools to motion planning problems for robots with constraints on the end effectors and/or internal joints of the robot. We show that RV-based planners are more efficient than existing methods, particularly for higher-dimensional problems, solving problems with 1000 or more degrees of freedom for multi-loop and tree-like linkages. }
