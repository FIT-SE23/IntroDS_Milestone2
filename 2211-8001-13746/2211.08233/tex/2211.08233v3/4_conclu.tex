In this paper, we propose a novel temporal emotional modeling approach, termed~\methodname, to learn multi-scale contextual affective representations from various time scales. 
\methodname can capture long-range temporal dependency through bi-direction temporal modeling and fuse multi-scale information dynamically for better adaptation to temporal scale variation. 
Our experimental results indicate that learning representation from the context information with dynamic temporal scales is crucial for the SER task. The ablation studies, visualizations, and domain generalization analysis further confirm the advantages of \methodname. 
In the future, we will investigate the disentanglement of emotion and speech content through the proposed temporal modeling approach for better generalization in cross-corpus SER tasks.
