\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Our cross-reality re-rendering system
supports users in manipulating their digital and physical realities. 
They can inspect their historical views, annotate objects, and share the interventions they generate.
We evaluate requirements  
with cognitive walkthroughs, scalability tests, and personas.
We hope this work continues to inspire further exploration of cross-reality systems into other realities.
