Searching for the term \textbf{P.h.D.}, the Collins dictionary\footnote{{\color{blue}{https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/phd}}} says :
\begin{displayquote}
\textit{A P.h.D. is a degree awarded to people who have done advanced research into a particular subject. P.h.D. is an abbreviation for ``Doctor of Philosophy''.}
\end{displayquote} 
Similarly, form Oxford dictionary\footnote{{\color{blue}{https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/phd?q=P.h.D}}}
\begin{displayquote}
P.h.D., noun.\\
\textit{Abbreviation for doctor of philosophy: the highest college or university degree.}
\end{displayquote} 
These two definitions make it seem like a solo effort, but in reality, I could never have accomplished this journey alone. Therefore, I would like to thank all those who have supported me during these years.

First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisors Prof. Miko\l{}aj Korzy{\'n}ski and Dr. Eleonora Villa, for their helpful advice, unwavering support, and patience throughout my doctoral studies. They introduced me to the broad and complicated world of research with their vast expertise and wealth of experience and inspired me throughout my studies.
 
I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all other professors of the Center for Theoretical Physics (CFT PAS) for their kind and open-minded attitude and for allowing me to carry out my research in a multidisciplinary and dynamic environment. I would especially like to thank Prof. L. Mankiewicz, Prof. K. Paw\l{}owski, and Prof. M. Bilicki for their help in starting the PhD procedure.
I would also like to thank the administrative and secretarial staff of CFT PAS for their unconditional help and endless patience in facilitating the complicated matters of bureaucracy.

At CTP PAS, I also had the opportunity to meet many more friends and colleagues. I am grateful to the other PhD students in room 304A, Julius, Ishika, Grzegorz, and Suhani, for accompanying me during this intense period and rejoicing with me over my achievements.
Furthermore, I cannot fail to mention ``the boss'', who has been a point of reference for my academic and professional decisions with her sincere and objective advice. \emph{In particular}, thank you for the endless meetings and virtual toasts.

I am immensely grateful to my parents, who have always supported and helped me with every decision I have ever made. Without the support of Orazio and Meletta, as well as Alfredo and Pina, I would never have become who I am today. Thank you for always being there for me.
I would also like to thank those who have become a second family to me: without the delightful distractions from my studies provided by my briscola-enthusiasts friends Mario, Lucia, Silvia, Stefano, Valeria, Fabrizio, Paola and Ruggero, I would not have been able to finish this dissertation. 

Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to Miriam for her unique understanding (over the past 16 years) and for seeing abilities in me that I did not even know I had. This thesis does not represent the end of an academic path but the beginning of a life together.
