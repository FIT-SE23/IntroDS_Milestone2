The work described in this thesis was undertaken between October 2017 and November 2021 while the author was a research student at the Center for Theoretical Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences. The work was done under the scientific supervision of Prof. Miko\l{}aj Korzy{\'n}ski and co-supervised by Dr. Eleonora Villa at Center for Theoretical Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences.
Under the same period, the author completed his coursework at the Institute of Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences. No part of this thesis has been submitted for any other degree at the Center for Theoretical Physics, Polish Academy of Sciences or any other university.
The abstract is translated into Polish by Prof. Miko\l{}aj Korzy{\'n}ski.

This thesis is based on the original results published in the following articles:\\
\begin{itemize}
        \item {\it Chapter}~\ref{chap:bigonlight}: {\textbf{``BiGONLight: light propagation with bilocal operators in Numerical Relativity.''} Authors: Michele Grasso and Eleonora Villa, published in Classical and Quantum Gravity (Class. Quant. Grav.) (\cite{Grasso:2021iwq}).} %published in Classical and Quantum Gravity (Class. Quant. Grav.) (\cite{2019MNRAS.487..755P}).}
         \item {\it Chapter}~\ref{chap:nonlinearities}: {\textbf{``Isolating nonlinearities of light propagation in inhomogeneous cosmologies.''} Authors: Michele Grasso, Eleonora Villa, Miko\l{}aj Korzy\'nski, and  Sabino Matarrese, published in Physical Review D (Phys. Rev. D) (\cite{Grasso:2021zra}). }
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Author's contributions}
The work described in Chapters~\ref{chap:bigonlight}-\ref{chap:nonlinearities} was performed in collaboration with the other co-authors (listed above). 
The author's main results are summarised in Sec.~\ref{sec:mainRes}, while a detailed description of the author's contribution is provided in the introductions of Chapters~\ref{chap:bigonlight}-\ref{chap:nonlinearities}.

\subsection*{Other works}
Apart from the two original works mentioned above, the author has contributed to the article \cite{Grasso:2018mei}
\begin{itemize}
     \item {\textbf{``Geometric optics in general relativity using bilocal operators.''} Authors: Michele Grasso, Miko\l{}aj Korzy\'nski, and Julius Serbenta, published in Physical Review D (Phys. Rev. D) (\cite{Grasso:2018mei}). } 
\end{itemize}

In the former work, a new formulation for light propagation in geometric optics by means of the bilocal geodesic operators is presented.
This novel formulation offers a consistent approach to optical phenomena in curved spacetimes, and it may be used to compute observables like angular diameter distance, luminosity distance, magnification, as well as new real-time observables like parallax and redshift drift, all within the same framework.
Although the results in \cite{Grasso:2018mei} are not included as original work of this thesis, the mathematical machinery of the BGO is presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:BGO} as it provides the theoretical framework on which the results in \cite{Grasso:2021iwq, Grasso:2021zra} are based.
