Apart from the two original works presented in Chapters~\ref{chap:bigonlight}-\ref{chap:nonlinearities}, the author has been involved in the article \cite{Grasso:2018mei}
\begin{itemize}
     \item {\textbf{``Geometric optics in general relativity using bilocal operators.''} Authors: Michele Grasso, Miko\l{}aj Korzy\'nski, and Julius Serbenta, published in Physical Review D (Phys. Rev. D) (\cite{Grasso:2018mei}). } 
\end{itemize}

In the former work, a new formulation for light propagation in geometric optics by means of the bilocal geodesic operators is presented.
%the new bilocal geodesic operators formulation of geometric optics and its application to describe congruences of null geodesics in general relativity have been presented. 
This novel formulation offers a consistent approach to optical phenomena in curved spacetimes, and it may be used to compute observables like angular diameter distance, luminosity distance, magnification, as well as new real-time observables like parallax and redshift drift, all within the same framework.
Although the results in \cite{Grasso:2018mei} are not included as original work of this thesis, the mathematical machinery of the BGO is presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:BGO} as it provides the theoretical framework on which the results in \cite{Grasso:2021iwq, Grasso:2021zra} are based.
