@article{Zhang2003plasticity,
	abstract = {In addition to synaptic plasticity, which confers neurons with the ability to modify the strength of individual synapses, nerve cells also possess forms of intrinsic plasticity (changes in intrinsic excitability), which affect largest ensembles of synapses and might affect the whole cell. This form of plasticity might endow neurons with an additional capacity to store information.Different learning tasks induce changes in intrinsic excitability in several vertebrate and invertebrate species. In many cases, these changes manifest as reductions in spike threshold, spike accommodation and amplitude of burst-evoked afterhyperpolarization, all of which point to the modulation of K+ channels as one potential underlying mechanism.Forms of experience-dependent plasticity other than learning also elicit intrinsic plasticity, which share similar mechanisms as learning-mediated plastic changes. These forms of experience include adaptive and maladaptive states, such as seizures.Studies in cell culture and brain slices have shown that it is possible to study intrinsic excitability in vitro. These studies have pointed to a series of K+, Ca2+ and Na+ conductances as possible molecular substrates of the plastic changes.The signal transduction cascades mediating the conductance changes that seem to be crucial for intrinsic plasticity remain unknown for most model systems. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and other kinases, the action of G-proteins, and the release of intracellular Ca2+ have been proposed, but the definitive experiments remain to be reported.Many changes remain to be answered in this nascent field. What is the relationship between intrinsic and synaptic plasticities, particularly in cases when both phenomena seem to co-exist? What is the duration of intrinsic plasticity? Does it really function to encode information? If so, what kind of memories could it store? These and many other issues should generate as much attention of intrinsic excitability changes as there has been on synaptic plasticity.},
