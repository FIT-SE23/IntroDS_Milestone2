abstract = {Objective
To illustrate the potential and challenges of the simultaneous analysis of a network of trials, using as a case study the investigation of the relative effectiveness of four topical fluoride treatments and two control interventions (placebo and no treatment) in preventing dental caries in children.
Study Design and Setting
We performed multiple-treatments meta-analysis within a Bayesian framework by synthesizing six Cochrane reviews. We explored the compatibility between direct and indirect evidence and adjusted the results using a meta-regression model to take into account differences in the year of randomization across studies.
Results
The validity of our conclusions for the superiority of fluoride toothpaste as indicated from the initial network analysis using Bayesian methods was challenged when we adjusted for possible confounders. The network was dominated by studies comparing placebo with toothpaste, which were older and had been carried out in populations with higher baseline risk than studies involving other fluoride modalities.
Conclusion
After adjusting for possible differences across studies, we did not find clear evidence that any topical fluoride modality is more effective than any other. Multiple-treatments meta-analysis methods allow for more detailed investigations than naïve methods in the analysis of indirect evidence on treatment effects.}

Mathematical modeling has played an integral role in improving our understanding of antibiotic resistance. In these models, parameter sensitivity is often assessed, while model structure sensitivity is not. To examine the implications of this, we first reviewed the literature on antibiotic-resistance modeling published between 1993 and 2011. We then classified each article's model structure into one or more of 6 categories based on the assumptions made in those articles regarding within-host and population-level competition between antibiotic-sensitive and antibiotic-resistant strains. Each model category has different dynamic implications with respect to how antibiotic use affects resistance prevalence, and therefore each may produce different conclusions about optimal treatment protocols that minimize resistance. Thus, even if all parameter values are correctly estimated, inferences may be incorrect because of the incorrect selection of model structure. Our framework provides insight into model selection.}",

abstract = {The threat to human health posed by antibiotic resistance is of growing concern. Many commensal and pathogenic organisms have developed resistance to well established and newer antibiotics. The major selection pressure driving changes in the frequency of antibiotic resistance is the volume of drug use. However, establishing a quantitative relationship between the frequency of resistance and volume of drug use has proved difficult. Using population genetic methods and epidemiological observations, we report an analysis of the influence of the selective pressure imposed by the volume of drug use on temporal changes in resistance. Analytical expressions are derived to delineate key relationships between resistance and drug consumption. The analyses indicate that the time scale for emergence of resistance under a constant selective pressure is typically much shorter than the decay time after cessation or decline in the volume of drug use and that significant reductions in resistance require equally significant reductions in drug consumption. These results highlight the need for early intervention once resistance is detected.}}
