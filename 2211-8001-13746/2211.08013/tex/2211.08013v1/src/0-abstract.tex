Volume estimation in large indoor spaces is an important challenge in robotic inspection of industrial warehouses. We propose an approach for volume estimation for autonomous systems using visual features for indoor localization and surface reconstruction from 2D-LiDAR measurements.
A Gaussian Process-based model incorporates information collected from measurements given statistical prior information about the terrain, from which the volume estimate is computed.
Our algorithm finds feasible trajectories which minimize the uncertainty of the volume estimate.
We show results in simulation for the surface reconstruction and volume estimate of topographic data.

 
%A robotic platform is used to automously collect experimental data and estimate the volume of a pile of bulk material in an indoor industrial environment. A LiDAR scanner attached to a drone measures the distance to the material, while the drone localization is infered from visual features. We propose a Gaussian Process based data stucture for volume estimation, and an computationally efficient variation for trajectory planning.
%A greedy algorithm is used to find feasible trajectories that minimize the uncertainty of the estimate of the volume of the pile.
