We develop and implement a framework for volume and uncertainty estimation for an autonomous robotic platform collecting experimental data with a LiDAR scanner under variable position uncertainty.
The surface reconstruction and volume estimation are validated in simulation with a feature rich surface, for two trajectories generated manually and with a simple greedy algorithm.
Future work will focus on the implementation of an improved planning algorithm employing a longer prediction horizon, validation in more complex maps with intricate constraints as well as experimental validation of the method.
