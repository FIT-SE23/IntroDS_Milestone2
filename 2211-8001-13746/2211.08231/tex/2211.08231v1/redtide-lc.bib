  abstract = {Data collected along the southwest coast of Florida between Tampa Bay and Sanibel Island on the abundance of the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis from 1954 to 2002 were examined for spatial and temporal patterns. K. brevis was found to be approximately 20-fold more abundant within 5 km of the shoreline than 20-30 km offshore. Overall, K. brevis was approximately 13-18-fold more abundant in 1994-2002 than in 1954-1963. In 1954-1963, K. brevis occurred primarily in the fall months. In 1994-2002, it was more abundant not only in the fall, but also in the winter and spring months. It is hypothesized that greater nutrient availability in the ecosystem is the most likely cause of this increase in K. brevis biomass, and the large increase in the human population and its activities in South Florida over the past half century is a major factor. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The region was divided into three sub-areas for analysis to accommodate geographic variation in potential forcing factors. The duration of the presence of K. brevis in northern Florida waters was not significantly related to either rainfall or flows. The central Florida region recorded significant correlations of K. brevis durations with a number of central Florida rainfall stations and with flows of most central and southern rivers examined. Lags were short (less than two months), if any, indicating relatively direct linkages. Relationships of K. brevis in southern Florida waters to rainfall, while similar to the central region, were significantly correlated for only a few south Florida rainfall stations and primarily with flows from the Peace River in south central Florida. Cross-correlations of K. brevis duration with departures of flow or rainfall from seasonal means were generally not significant.}

  abstract = {The mechanisms governing dispersion processes in the northern Yucatan coast are investigated using a barotropic numerical model of coastal circulation, which includes wind-generated and large scale currents (i.e. Yucatan Current). This work provides the foundations for studying the dispersion of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in the area. Modelling experiments include effects of climatic wind (from long term monthly mean NCEP reanalysis), short term wind events (from in situ point measurements), and Yucatan Current (YC) characteristics. Its magnitude was approximated from published reports, and its trajectory from geostrophic current fields derived from altimeter data. These provided a range of real and climatic conditions to study the routes in which phytoplankton blooms may travel. The 2-D model results show that a synthetic and conservative bloom seeded in the Cabo Catoche (CC) region (where it usually grows), moves along the coast to the west up to San Felipe (SF), where it can either move offshore, or carry on travelling westwards. The transport to the west up to SF is greatly influenced by the trajectory, intensity and proximity of the YC jet to the peninsula, which enhances the westward circulation in the Yucatan Shelf. Numerical experiments show that patch dispersion is consistently to the west even under the influence of northerly winds. When the YC flows westward towards the Campeche Bank, momentum transfer caused by the YC jet dominates the dispersion processes over wind stress. On the other hand, when it flows closer to Cuba, the local processes (i.e. wind and bathymetry) become dominant. Coastal orientation and the Coriolis force may be responsible for driving the patch offshore at SF if external forcing decreases. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

They kill large numbers of fish and cause illness in humans who ingest toxic filter-feeding shellfish or inhale toxic aerosols. The toxins are also suspected of having been involved in events in which many manatees and dolphins died, but this has usually not been verified owing to limited confirmation of toxin exposure, unexplained intoxication mechanisms and complicating pathologies. Here we show that fish and seagrass can accumulate high concentrations of brevetoxins and that these have acted as toxin vectors during recent deaths of dolphins and manatees, respectively. Our results challenge claims that the deleterious effects of a brevetoxin on fish (ichthyotoxicity) preclude its accumulation in live fish, and they reveal a new vector mechanism for brevetoxin spread through food webs that poses a threat to upper trophic levels.},

Less well-known are the extents of the basins of attractions of these regions and how strongly attracting they are. Understanding the shape and extent of the basins of attraction sheds light on the question of the strength of connectivity of different regions of the ocean, which helps in understanding the flow of buoyant material like plastic litter. Using short flow time trajectory data from a global ocean model, we create a Markov chain model of the surface ocean dynamics. The surface ocean is not a conservative dynamical system as water in the ocean follows three-dimensional pathways, with upwelling and downwelling in certain regions. Using our Markov chain model, we easily compute net surface upwelling and downwelling, and verify that it matches observed patterns of upwelling and downwelling in the real ocean. We analyze the Markov chain to determine multiple attracting regions. Finally, using an eigenvector approach, we (i) identify the five major ocean garbage patches, (ii) partition the ocean into basins of attraction for each of the garbage patches, and (iii) partition the ocean into regions that demonstrate transient dynamics modulo the attracting garbage patches.},

The measurements are of sea level and currents along the coastline and across the shelf, respectively. The model extends from west of the Mississippi River to the Florida Keys with an open boundary arcing between. It is along this open boundary that the regional model is forced by a global tide model. Standard barotropic tidal analyses are performed for both the data and the model, and quantifiable metrics are provided for comparison. Based on these comparisons, the authors present coamplitude and cophase charts for sea level and velocity hodographs for currents. The semidiurnal constituents show marked spatial variability, whereas the diurnal constituents are spatially more uniform. Apalachicola Bay is a demarcation point for the semidiurnal tides that are well developed to the southeast along the WFS but are minimal to the west. The largest semidiurnal tides are in the Florida Big Bend and Florida Bay regions with a relative minimum in between just to the south of Tampa Bay. These spatial distributions may be explained on the basis of local geometry. A Lagrangian Stokes drift, coherently directed toward the northwest, is identified but is of relatively small magnitude when compared with the potential for particle transport by seasonal and synoptic-scale forcing. Bottom stress-induced tidal mixing is examined and estimates are made of the bottom logarithmic layer height by the M2 tidal currents.},

Karenia brevis, which blooms frequently in the Gulf of Mexico, has a relatively slow growth rate (doubling times of 2-3 days). Increases in K. brevis concentration cannot be explained simply in terms of growth. We hypothesize that the primary mechanism responsible for bloom formation in the western Gulf of Mexico is convergence due to downwelling at the coast. Convergence along the Texas coast caused by seasonal downwelling winds can concentrate the plankton up to 1000 times. This is surprising because the modeled cells do not grow; the simulated increase in concentration is due to physical processes alone. The numerical model qualitatively reproduces both the timing and magnitude of bloom initiation along the coast, but does not predict the details of the migration of the bloom along the coast after it has formed, or the destruction of the bloom. The result of this simulation is significant because it implies that K. brevis blooms may be caused primarily by physical processes and that cell division is not an important factor in bloom formation.

  abstract = {Loop Current Frontal Eddies (LCFEs) are known to intensify and assist in the Loop Current (LC) eddy shedding. In addition to interacting with the LC, these eddies also modify the circulation in the eastern Gulf of Mexico by attracting water and passive tracers such as chlorophyll, Mississippi freshwater, and pollutants to the LC-LCFE front. During the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill, part of the oil was entrained not only in the LC-LCFE front but also inside an LCFE, where it remained for weeks. This study assesses the ability of the LCFEs to transport water and passive tracers without exchange with the exterior (i.e., Lagrangian coherence) using altimetry and a high-resolution model. The following open questions are answered: (1) How long can the LCFEs remain Lagrangian coherent at and below the surface? (2) What is the source of water for the formation of LCFEs? (3) Can the formation of Lagrangian coherent LCFEs attract shelf water? Strong frontal eddies leading to LC eddy shedding are investigated using a 1-km resolution model for the Gulf of Mexico and altimetry. The results show that LCFEs are composed of waters originating from the outer band of the LC front, the region north of the LC, and the western West Florida Shelf and Mississippi/Alabama/Florida shelf, and potentially drive cross-shelf exchange of particles, water properties, and nutrients. At depth ({$\approx$}180 m), most LCFE water comes from the outer band of the LC front in the form of smaller frontal eddies. Once formed, LCFEs can transport water and passive tracers in their interior without exchange with the exterior for weeks: these eddies remained Lagrangian coherent for up to 25 days in the altimetry dataset and 18 days at the surface and 29 days at depth ({$\approx$}180 m) in the simulation. LCFE can remain Lagrangian coherent up to a depth of {$\approx$} 560 m. Additional analyses show that the LCFE involved in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill formed from water near the oil rig location, in agreement with previous studies. Temperature-salinity diagrams from a high-resolution model and aircraft expendable profilers show that LCFEs are composed of Gulf of Mexico water as opposed to LC water. Therefore, LCFE formation and propagation actively modify the surrounding circulation and affect the evolution of the flow and the transport of oil and other passive tracers in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico.},

  abstract = {The initiation of the toxic harmful algal bloom (HAB), Karenia brevis, along the west Florida coast has been associated with upwelling events. Upwelling processes may be responsible for the transport of nutrients or algae from deep offshore locations across the Florida shelf to the coast. The influence of coastal wind-driven upwelling on the onset and occurrences of K. brevis in this region was numerically investigated using Rutgers University's Regional Ocean Modeling System. Computations were carried out in an idealized model domain, a two-dimensional slice in the cross-shore and vertical directions. The surface forcing data used was from several offshore meteorological buoys. The motion of the algae was simulated using Lagrangian particles and a passive tracer. The numerical simulations of three K. brevis events in 2000-2002 showed that the particles respond (with upwelling/downwelling) to the along-shore wind stresses as expected and some upwelling was present during the events. Comparison of the passive tracer fields with measured fluorescence data exposed the model's sensitivity to the particular surface forcing data employed and the relatively more significant role played by surface forcing over initial conditions. The present model set-up constitutes a useful predictive tool for conditions conducive to the onset of HABs. It is planned to be used in a real-time mode to aid the NOAA HAB monitoring and forecasting system. \textcopyright{} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

K. brevis commonly causes major fish kills, human respiratory distress, and significant economic disruption in the Gulf of Mexico. It can also lead to illness by consumption of contaminated shellfish. The nearly annual blooms that have occurred in Florida in the past several decades have focused most attention on the eastern Gulf of Mexico. There are few published chronological accounts of red tides in the western Gulf of Mexico despite a wealth of information on probable red tide blooms in Mexico during the 17th-19th century. Using these data and more modern records, we present a chronology of K. brevis in the western Gulf of Mexico. A 1879 report of red tide blooms in Veracruz, Mexico in the period 1853-1871 provides a clear description of concurrent fish kills and respiratory irritation, and provides the earliest verifiable account of K. brevis in the Gulf of Mexico. An analysis of the records suggests that Texas has experienced a notable increase in red tide frequency in the years 1996-2000. However, the record is too limited to assign any causes. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

This is done by building aMarkov-chain representation of the Lagrangian dynamics. The geography is composed of weakly interacting provinces that constrain the connectivity at depth. Themain geography includes two provinces of near-equal areas separated by a roughlymeridional boundary. The residence time is about 4.5 (3.5) years in the western (eastern) province. The exchange between these provinces is effected through a slow cyclonic circulation, which is well constrained in the western basin by preservation of f/H, where f is the Coriolis parameter and H is depth. Secondary provinces of varied shapes covering smaller areas are identified with residence times ranging from about 0.4 to 1.2 years or so. Except for the main provinces, the deep Lagrangian geography does not resemble the surface Lagrangian geography recently inferred from satellite-tracked drifter trajectories. This implies disparate connectivity characteristics with potential implications for pollutant (e.g., oil) dispersal at the surface and at depth. Support for our results is provided by a Markov-chain analysis of satellitetracked profiling (Argo) floats, which, while forming a smaller dataset and having seemingly different waterfollowing characteristics than theRAFOS floats, replicate the main aspects of the Lagrangian geography.Our results find further validation in independent results from a chemical tracer release experiment.},

  abstract = {Analysis of year-long drifter trajectories and records of simulated surface Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCSs) have suggested the presence of a resilient Cross-Shelf Transport Barrier (CSTB) on the West Florida Shelf (WFS). The CSTB was conjectured to provide a large degree of isolation, which is consequential for the fueling of red tides on the southern WFS by nutrients possibly released by rivers and canals directly on the region. Here this conjecture is thoroughly tested by identifying LCSs as well as performing tracer advection calculations based on seven-year-long records of surface and subsurface currents produced by a HYbrid-Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM) simulation of the Gulf of Mexico (GoM). The identified LCSs suggest that the CSTB extends downward in the water column. The tracer calculations suggest that, while the majority of the nutrients possibly released by rivers and canals directly on the southern WFS are retained within the region for long times, only a small fraction of the nutrients possibly released by rivers outside the WFS reach the southern WFS, mainly accompanying shoreward excursions of the CSTB. These results add importance to the role played by the CSTB in controlling red tide development on the WFS. Implications of the results for the dispersal of pollutants, such as oil, in the GoM are discussed. \textcopyright{} Author(s) 2010.},

  abstract = {Analysis of drifter trajectories in the Gulf of Mexico has revealed the existence of a region on the southern portion of the West Florida Shelf (WFS) that is not visited by drifters that are released outside of the region. This so-called "forbidden zone" (FZ) suggests the existence of a persistent cross-shelf transport barrier on the southern portion of the WFS. In this letter a year-long record of surface currents produced by a Hybrid-Coordinate Ocean Model simulation of the WFS is used to compute Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs), which reveal the presence of a persistent cross-shelf transport barrier in approximately the same location as the boundary of the FZ. The location of the cross-shelf transport barrier undergoes a seasonal oscillation, being closer to the coast in the summer than in the winter. A month-long record of surface currents inferred from high-frequency (HF) radar measurements in a roughly 60 km \texttimes{} 80 km region on the WFS off Tampa Bay is also used to compute LCSs, and these also reveal the presence of transient transport barriers. While the HF-radar-derived transport barriers cannot be unambiguously linked to the boundary of the FZ, this analysis does demonstrate the feasibility of monitoring transport barriers on the WFS using a HF-radar-based measurement system. The implications of a persistent cross-shelf transport barrier on the WFS for the development of harmful algal blooms on the shoreward side of the barrier are considered.

  abstract = {Several theories have been proposed to explain the development of harmful algal blooms (HABs) produced by the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis on the West Florida Shelf. However, because the early stages of HAB development are usually not detected, these theories have been so far very difficult to verify. In this paper we employ simulated Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) to trace potential early locations of the development of a HAB in late 2004 before it was transported to a region where it could be detected by satellite imagery. The LCSs, which are extracted from surface ocean currents produced by a data-assimilative HYCOM (HYbrid-Coordinate Ocean Model) simulation, constitute material fluid barriers that demarcate potential pathways for HAB evolution. Using a simplified population dynamics model we infer the factors that could possibly lead to the development of the HAB in question. The population dynamics model determines nitrogen in two components, nutrients and phytoplankton, which are assumed to be passively advected by surface ocean currents produced by the above HYCOM simulation. Two nutrient sources are inferred for the HAB whose evolution is found to be strongly tied to the simulated LCSs. These nutrient sources are found to be located nearshore and possibly due to land runoff. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

  abstract = {From the late Pliocene to now, blooms of toxic algae are associated with mortalities of marine birds. Given the long historical presence of harmful algal blooms (HABs) worldwide and the numbers of seabirds that feed on filter-feeding fish and shellfish, it is surprising that relatively few incidents of seabird deaths as a result of toxic algae have been reported. The limited information available tends to come from major events, whereas the rare events are missed and hence not reported. Much is anecdotal and still more probably is not published. We suspect that factors working in concert may lead to deaths and wrecks that might not occur as a result of anyone factor working independently, e.g. starvation tends to render birds more vulnerable to stress. "Seabird wrecks", very much larger than usual concentration of seabird corpses washed ashore over a short period of time, often provide evidence of deleterious conditions in offshore populations, e.g. weather, food, pollution, fishing activities, and parasites. It is noted in the literature that wrecks caused by natural toxins such as botulism and algal toxins are apparently less common; however, this perception may be due to a combination of factors including the bird species involved, size of populations, location, and chance of discovery. Wrecks involving near-shore species probably provide a more accurate estimate of total mortality for any given event than offshore species. A survey of available data on the impacts of toxic algae on seabirds revealed an array of responses ranging from reduced feeding activity, inability to lay eggs, and loss of motor coordination to death. Severe impacts on recruitment have been noted in some populations. There are few experimental studies; however, evidence has been provided for the ability of some species to 'learn' to avoid toxic food sources. We present a summary of available data on seabird/toxic algal interactions and suggestions of how impacts on seabirds during future blooms of harmful algae be recorded. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

  abstract = {Harmful algal blooms (HABs) of Karenia brevis are a recurrent problem in the Gulf of Mexico, with nearly annual occurrences on the Florida southwest coast, and fewer occurrences on the northwest Florida and Texas coasts. Beginning in 1999, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has issued the Gulf of Mexico HAB Bulletins to support state monitoring and management efforts. These bulletins involve analysis of satellite imagery with field and meteorological station data. The effort involves several components or models: (a) monitoring the movement of an algal bloom that has previously been identified as a HAB (type 1 forecast); (b) detecting new blooms as HAB or non-HAB (type 2); (c) predicting the movement of an identified HAB (type 3); (d) predicting conditions favorable for a HAB to occur where blooms have not yet been observed (type 4). The types 1 and 2 involve methods of bloom detection requiring routine remote sensing, especially satellite ocean color imagery and in situ data. Prediction (types 3 and 4) builds on the monitoring capability by using interpretative and numerical modeling. Successful forecasts cover more than 1000km of coast and require routine input of remotely sensed and in situ data. The data sources used in this effort include ocean color imagery from the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor/OrbView-2 satellite and processed using coastal-specific algorithms, wind data from coastal and offshore buoys, field observations of bloom location and intensity provided by state agencies, and forecasts from the National Weather Service. The HAB Bulletins began in coordination with the state of Florida in autumn of 1999 and included K. brevis bloom monitoring (type 1), with limited advisories on transport (type 3) and the detection of blooms in new areas (type 2). In autumn 2000, we improved both the transport forecasts and detection capabilities and began prediction of conditions favorable for bloom development (type 4). The HAB Bulletins have had several successes. The state of Florida was advised of the potential for a bloom to occur at the end of September 2000 (type 4), and the state was alerted to the position of blooms in January 2000 and October 2001 in areas that had not been previously sampled (type 3). These successful communications of HAB activity allowed Florida agencies responsible for shellfish management and public health to respond to a rapidly developing event in a timely, efficient manner. \textcopyright{} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

A midshell front maintained by seasonal wind reversals along the Florida west coast may serve as a growth and accumulation region for G. breve blooms and continue to the reinoculation of nearshore waters.

The West Florida Shelf is oligotrophic, yet populations {$>$}106 cells L-1 frequently occur and blooms can persist for months. Here we examine the magnitude and variety of sources for N and P that are available to support blooms. Annual average in situ or background concentrations of inorganic N in the region where blooms occur range 0.02-0.2 {$\mu$}M while inorganic P ranges 0.025-0.24 {$\mu$}M. Such concentrations would be sufficient to support the growth of populations up to {$\sim$}3\texttimes 104 cells L-1 with at least a 1 d turnover rate. Organic N concentrations average 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than inorganic N, 8-14 {$\mu$}M while organic P concentrations average 0.2-0.5 {$\mu$}M. Concentrations of organic N are sufficient to support blooms {$>$}105 cells L-1 but the extent to which this complex mixture of N species is utilizable is unknown. Other sources of nutrients included in our analysis are aerial deposition, estuarine flux, benthic flux, zooplankton excretion, N2-fixation, and subsequent release of organic and inorganic N by Trichodesmium spp., and release of N and P from dead and decaying fish killed by the blooms. Inputs based on atmospheric deposition, benthic flux, and N2-fixation, were minor contributors to the flux required to support growth of populations {$>$}2.6\texttimes 104 cells L-1. N and P from decaying fish could theoretically maintain populations at moderate concentrations but insufficient data on the flux and subsequent mixing rates does not allow us to calculate average values. Zooplankton excretion rates, based on measured zooplankton population estimates and excretion rates could also supply all of the N and P required to support populations of 105 and 106 cells L-1, respectively, but excretion is considered as "regenerated" nutrient input and can only maintain biomass rather than contribute to "new" biomass. The combined estuarine flux from Tampa Bay, Charlotte Harbor, and the Caloosahatchee River can supply a varying, but at times significant level of N and P to meet growth and photosynthesis requirements for populations of approximately 105 cells L-1 or below. Estimates of remineralization of dead fish could supply a significant proportion of bloom maintenance requirements but the rate of supply must still be determined.

The simulated vertical movement of K. brevis, in response to light-cued migration and nocturnal mixing, also mimics these aspects of the next fall red tide in 1980, suggesting that sunrise populations may provide the strongest surface signal, for detection of red tides by remote sensors aboard aircraft and satellites. Once a mature red tide is formed, a light-regulated maximal growth rate of 0.15 day-1 reflecting nutrient-limitation, and no other loss processes may be an adequate description of population dynamics above the 30-40 m isobaths, where blooms of K. brevis originate. Within shallow waters at the 10-m isobath, however, an apparent larger growth rate of 0.80 day-1 - As a presumed consequence of frontal aggregations - Must be offset by unknown processes of algal mortality.

However, coupled biophysical models of (1) wind- and buoyancy-driven circulation, (2) three phytoplankton groups (diatoms, K. brevis, and microflagellates), (3) these slope water supplies of nitrate and silicate, and (4) selective grazing stress by copepods and protozoans found that diatoms won in one 1998 case of no light limitation by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The diatoms lost to K. brevis during another CDOM case of the models. In the real world, field data confirmed that diatoms were indeed the dominant phytoplankton after massive upwelling in 1998, when only a small red tide of K. brevis was observed. Over a 7-month period of the CDOM-free scenario the simulated total primary production of the phytoplankton community was {$\sim$}1.8 g C m-2 d-1 along the 40-m isobath of the northern WFS, with the largest accumulation of biomass on the Florida Middle Ground (FMG). Despite such photosynthesis, these models of the WFS yielded a net source Of CO2 to the atmosphere during spring and summer and suggested a small sink in the fall. With diatom losses of 90\% of their daily carbon fixation to herbivores the simulation supported earlier impressions of a short, diatom-based food web on the FMG, where organic carbon content of the surficial sediments is tenfold those of the surrounding seabeds. Farther south, the simulated near-bottom pools of ammonium were highest in summer, when silicon regeneration was minimal, leading to temporary Si limitation of the diatoms. Termination of these upwelled pulses of production by diatoms and nonsiliceous microflagellates mainly resulted from nitrate exhaustion in the model, however, mimicking most del15PON observations in the field. Yet, the CDOM-free case of the models failed to replicate the observed small red tide in December 1998, tagged with the del15N signature of nitrogen fixation. A large red tide of K. brevis did form in the CDOM-rich case, when estuarine supplies of CDOM favored the growth of the shade-adapted, ungrazed dinoflagellates. The usual formation of large harmful algal blooms of{$>$}1 ug chl L-1 (105 cells L-1) in the southern part of the WFS, between Tampa Bay and Charlotte Harbor, must instead depend upon local aeolian and estuarine supplies of nutrients and CDOM sun screen, not those from the shelf break. In the absence of slope water supplies, local upwelling instead focuses nitrate-poor innocula of co-occurring K. brevis and nitrogen fixers at coastal fronts for both aggregation and transfer of nutrients between these phytoplankton groups.},

  abstract = {Independent data from the Gulf of Mexico are used to develop and test the hypothesis that the same sequence of physical and ecological events each year allows the toxic dinoflagellate Karenia brevis to become dominant. A phosphorus-rich nutrient supply initiates phytoplankton succession, once deposition events of Saharan iron-rich dust allow Trichodesmium blooms to utilize ubiquitous dissolved nitrogen gas within otherwise nitrogen-poor sea water. They and the co-occurring K. brevis are positioned within the bottom Ekman layers, as a consequence of their similar diel vertical migration patterns on the middle shelf. Upon onshore upwelling of these near-bottom seed populations to CDOM-rich surface waters of coastal regions, light-inhibition of the small red tide of {$\sim$}1 ug chl 1-1 of ichthytoxic K. brevis is alleviated. Thence, dead fish serve as a supplementary nutrient source, yielding large, self-shaded red tides of {$\sim$}10 ug chl 1-1. The source of phosphorus is mainly of fossil origin off west Florida, where past nutrient additions from the eutrophied Lake Okeechobee had minimal impact. In contrast, the P-sources are of mainly anthropogenic origin off Texas, since both the nutrient loadings of Mississippi River and the spatial extent of the downstream red tides have increased over the last 100 years. During the past century and particularly within the last decade, previously cryptic Karenia spp. have caused toxic red tides in similar coastal habitats of other western boundary currents off Japan, China, New Zealand, Australia, and South Africa, downstream of the Gobi, Simpson, Great Western, and Kalahari Deserts, in a global response to both desertification and eutrophication.

  abstract = {Prediction of the consequences of harmful algal blooms for humans and other vertebrates is constrained by an inadequate understanding of the factors that promote their initiation. A simple exponential growth model of net production is used for analysis of four time series at different sampling intervals over similar to 40 years of red tide strandings, associated fish kills, and concomitant dust loadings on the West Florida shelf. At least large summer blooms of a toxic dinoflagellate Gymnodinium breve appear to be primed regularly by an aeolian supply of nutrients. Wet deposition of Saharan mineral aerosols may alleviate iron limitation of diazotrophic cyanophytes, which in turn fuel the nitrogen economy of red tides in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. Vagaries of the wind-induced circulation and of selective grazing pressure on phytoplankton competitors within phosphorus replete coastal waters then determine each year the residence times for exposure of G. breve-mediated neurotoxins to fish, manatees, and humans along the southeastern United States.},

  abstract = {We compare west Florida shelf velocity and sea level data with a model simulation for April 1998. Responses for three upwelling and three downwelling favorable wind events are documented. Along-shelf jets accompanied by oppositely directed upper and lower layer across-shelf flows (with connecting vertical velocity) comprise the fully three-dimensional inner shelf responses, which are sensitive to stratification. With an initial density field representative of April 1998 the model simulates velocity and sea level variations in general agreement with the observations, whereas substantial mismatches occur without stratification. Despite the winds being the primary motive agent for the inner shelf the stratification dependence requires that model density fields be maintained through a combination of adequate initial conditions; surface, offshore, and land-derived buoyancy inputs; and data assimilation. Dynamical analyses define the inner shelf as the region where the surface and bottom boundary layers are important in the momentum balance. Kinematically, this is where surface Ekman layer divergence, fed by the bottom Ekman layer convergence, or conversely, sets up the across-shelf pressure gradient. Stratification causes a response asymmetry wherein the offshore scale and magnitude of the upwelling responses are larger than those for the downwelling responses. This asymmetry is attributed to thermal wind effects across the bottom Ekman layer. Buoyancy torque by isopycnals bending into the bottom adds constructively (destructively) with planetary vorticity tilting under upwelling (downwelling) favorable winds, and this may have important implications for nutrients and other material property distributions on the shelf.

  abstract = {This paper presents some recent results of drifters released on the West Florida Shelf during 1996-1997 and compares with the numerical model results of the wind-driven circulation. Using satellite tracked surface drifters during the one year period from February 1996 to February 1997, a drifter free region, called the 'forbidden zone', is found over the southern portion of the West Florida Shelf. This finding is consistent with historical drift bottle data and with a recent numerical model study of the West Florida Shelf circulation response to climatological wind forcing. Direct drifter simulations by numerical model during March 1996 show a good agreement with both the in situ ADCP current observation and drifter observation. Three mechanisms are proposed for the observed Lagrangian features. The primarily dynamic mechanism is the along-shore wind forcing, which induces a coastal jet that tends to leave the coast and the bottom onshore and near surface offshore transports. The second one is the convergent coastal geometry and bottom topography for the southward flow in central shelf near Tampa Bay that enforces the coastal jet and the bottom and near surface transport. The last is a kinematic one, simply due to the short along-shore Lagrangian excursion, driven by the typical synoptic weather systems. Thus near surface shelf waters over the north may not reach the southern coast of the West Florida. Implication is that surface hazard such as oil spill that may occur outside of the southern West Florida shelf may not greatly impact the southern coastal region except Florida Keys. However, the biological and chemical patches over the north that may occur in the water column such as red tides still can easily reach the southern coastal region through the subsurface and bottom waters.}
