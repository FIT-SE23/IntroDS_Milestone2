  abstract = {This paper describes a robust and efficient method for solving the equations corresponding to an equation-of-state (EOS) compositional model. The method is developed for an adaptive-implicit simulator in which only a small number of blocks need to be solved implicitly while the remaining blocks are solved explicitly. The salient features of the method are decoupling of the solution of flow equations from the flash calculations and switching from explicit to implicit formulations on the basis of a stability criterion. The performance of the adaptive-implicit approach is compared with that of a fully implicit approach and an explicit-transmissibility approach. Results show that the adaptive-implicit approach is two to three times faster than the other two methods.},

  abstract = {Variational autoencoders (VAEs) with an auto-regressive decoder have been applied for many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The VAE objective consists of two terms, (i) reconstruction and (ii) KL regularization, balanced by a weighting hyper-parameter \textbackslash beta. One notorious training difficulty is that the KL term tends to vanish. In this paper we study scheduling schemes for \textbackslash beta, and show that KL vanishing is caused by the lack of good latent codes in training the decoder at the beginning of optimization. To remedy this, we propose a cyclical annealing schedule, which repeats the process of increasing \textbackslash beta multiple times. This new procedure allows the progressive learning of more meaningful latent codes, by leveraging the informative representations of previous cycles as warm re-starts. The effectiveness of cyclical annealing is validated on a broad range of NLP tasks, including language modeling, dialog response generation and unsupervised language pre-training.},

  abstract = {Compositional models are frequently used to describe fluids in petroleum reservoir simulation, particularly for simulations of enhanced oil recovery. While compositional models are more accurate than black oil models, they incur a larger computational cost, in part, due to more complex phase-equilibrium calculations and can result in longer run times. Here, we develop an algorithm to reduce the cost of phase-equilibrium calculations for compositional models by applying two machine learning techniques: relevance vector machines and artificial neural networks. We test the algorithm on three fluid data sets and find a speedup of over 20\% with an error of 0.01\%, and a speedup of over 90\% with a maximum error of 5\%. These results suggest that the algorithm can be used to reduce the overall run time of compositional reservoir simulations with a small impact on accuracy.},

  abstract = {Overparameterized neural networks can be highly accurate on average on an i.i.d. test set yet consistently fail on atypical groups of the data (e.g., by learning spurious correlations that hold on average but not in such groups). Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) allows us to learn models that instead minimize the worst-case training loss over a set of pre-defined groups. However, we find that naively applying group DRO to overparameterized neural networks fails: these models can perfectly fit the training data, and any model with vanishing average training loss also already has vanishing worst-case training loss. Instead, the poor worst-case performance arises from poor generalization on some groups. By coupling group DRO models with increased regularization---a stronger-than-typical L2 penalty or early stopping---we achieve substantially higher worst-group accuracies, with 10-40 percentage point improvements on a natural language inference task and two image tasks, while maintaining high average accuracies. Our results suggest that regularization is important for worst-group generalization in the overparameterized regime, even if it is not needed for average generalization. Finally, we introduce a stochastic optimization algorithm, with convergence guarantees, to efficiently train group DRO models.},

  abstract = {We analyze several widely used nonlinear formulations for general-purpose compositional reservoir simulation. All the formulations are implemented using a unified computational framework based on automatic differentiation. The numerical behaviors using different variable sets, including the so-called natural and mass variables, are investigated. The fully implicit method (FIM) is used throughout this work. In the FIM framework, the full Jacobian matrix with all the equations and constraint relations as a function of the primary and secondary variables is computed. For a given formulation, rigorous construction of the Schurcomplement, in which the full Jacobian is reduced to a system for the primary equations in terms of the primary unknowns, is performed purely algebraically. We study multi-component multiphase displacements with significant pressure variation in both space and time, and we focus on challenges posed by nonlinear phenomena, including the appearance and disappearance of phases, and crossing into and out of the critical region. We analyze the behavior of the Newton-based nonlinear solver as a function of timestep size for different variable sets and for different nonlinear updating strategies.},

  abstract = {The flash calculation with large capillary pressure often turns out to be time-consuming and unstable. Consequently, the compositional simulation of unconventional oil/gas reservoirs, where large capillary pressure exists on the vapor-liquid phase interface due to the narrow pore channel, becomes a challenge to traditional reservoir simulation techniques. In this work, we try to resolve this issue by combining deep learning technology with reservoir simulation. We have developed a compositional simulator that is accelerated and stabilized by stochastically-trained proxy flash calculation.},
