abstract = {A full numerical description of second- and third-harmonic generation (SHG and THG) at the focus of a nonlinear microscope is presented. The numerical implementation takes into account reflections and refraction by an arbi- trary number of interfaces perpendicular to the optical axis in the focal region. The calculation of the second- and third-harmonic far-field radiation pattern is based on a Green function approach and is presented for any collec- tion direction. The calculations are sped up by using the chirp-z transform for the focusing fields as well as for the far-field radiation calculation. Numerical evidence is presented for deviations in the measurement of the second- order nonlinear susceptibility ratio $\rho$ ≡ $\chi$2 yyy∕$\chi$2 yxx of collagen fibers in SHG microscopy at high excitation numerical aperture. When interface reflections are taken into account, significant direct backwardTHGis demonstrated from interfaces and multilayer structures.},

abstract = {Abstract Due to its properties, lithium niobate is one of the most suitable material platforms for the implementation of integrated optical quantum circuits. With the commercialization of lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) substrates in the recent years, the lithium niobate nanostructuring technology has progressed immensely. Now nanostructured LNOI components can be fabricated with a quality on par with any other material platform, and could act as effective building blocks for integrated quantum circuits. The advanced nanostructuring technology combined with its favorable material properties make the LNOI platform a real contender for the realization of large-scale optical quantum circuits. The aim of this perspective article is to examine the utility of the LNOI platform toward this goal. To do this, first the availability of the individual components that can act as the building blocks for such circuits is investigated. Afterward, a fully on-chip implementation of a multiplexed source of single photons on the LNOI platform is envisioned, which is a highly challenging task in all material platforms. Based on the performance of the state-of-the-art components on the LNOI platform, the performance of such a device is quantified and the areas in which more progress is needed are pointed out.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a rigorous and general theoretical model for the illumination point spread function of a confocal microscope that correctly reproduces the optical setup. The model uses vectorial theory and assumes that monochromatic light with a Gaussian intensity distribution (such as from a laser or a single-mode fiber) is focused by a microscope objective with high numerical aperture and passes through stratified media on its way to the sample. This covers the important practical case of illumination through up to three layers, which is the situation most commonly encountered in biological microscopy (immersion oil, glass coverslip, aqueous sample medium). It also accounts for objectives that are corrected for a certain coverslip thickness and refractive index but operated under non-design conditions. Furthermore, illumination with linearly, circularly, or elliptically polarized light is covered by introducing a Babinet-Soleil compensator into the beam path. The model leads to a set of analytical equations that are readily evaluated. Two-dimensional intensity distributions for particular cases of interest are presented and discussed.},
