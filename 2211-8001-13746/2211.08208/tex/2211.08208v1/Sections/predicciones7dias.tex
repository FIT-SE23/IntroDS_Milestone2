In this section we show some predictions for Guanajuato and Mexico made with the different models and comparisons between the predictions and the difference with the real value. We employ the data shown in online by the sources \cite{datosGTO,datosMX}\\
%Puse que tambien para mexico usamos varios modelos lo cual a la fecha es falso, tener cuidado tal vez necesitamos cambiarlo
\textbf{Guanajuato predictions.}\\
First predictions were made from day 05/25/21 to 06/17/21 blue line is the prediction made with $\beta_s$ model for 21 days.

\end{figure}

In the next tables we can see the difference between real data and predictions with different models, where error was calculated with the difference in real data and the respective prediction.

%------------------------------------------
Here we show more predictions made from 4/18/21 to 5/12/21 for 21 days.

    \label{lab8}
\end{figure}

As we can see in tables in this section and figure 14 vaccinated model tends to report less infected people and it is a better approximation to real data.\\

\textbf{Mexico predictions.}\\
Predictions applying the $\beta_s$ model for the whole country with detection rate of 0.1.

    \label{lab11}
\end{figure}
In general deceased and recover people predictions behave as expected, the prediction error encloses the real data.\\
More interesting is the infected people predictions as we can see in the next figure the predictions error do not enclose real data, even whit the big error region, the accuracy depends a lot on when we made the prediction, a possible explanation is that Mexico is a country with 128 million people and as we can see in figure 8 approximate the detection rate and other constants as the recovery or infection rate as if it is the same for the whole country is not optimal as Guanajuato predictions.

To finish the predictions sections we present infected predictions for Guanajuato and México made with the $\beta_s$ model, in section \ref{sec 11} we present more predictions for Guanajuato and México.
