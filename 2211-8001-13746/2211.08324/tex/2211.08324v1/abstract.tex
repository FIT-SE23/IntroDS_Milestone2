Flexible graph connectivity is a new network design model introduced
by Adjiashvili \cite{Adjiashvili13}. It has seen several recent
algorithmic advances
\cite{AdjiashviliHM20,AdjiashviliHM22,AdjiashviliHMS20,BoydCHI22,BansalCGI22,ChekuriJ22}. Despite
these, the approximability even in the 
setting of a single-pair $(s,t)$ is poorly understood. In
\cite{ChekuriJ22} we raised the question of whether there is
poly-logarithmic approximation for the survivable network design
version (Flex-SNDP) when the connectivity requirements are fixed
constants. In this paper, we adapt a powerful framework for
survivable network design recently developed by Chen, Laekhanukit,
Liao, and Zhang \cite{ChenLLZ22} to give an affirmative answer to the
question. The framework of \cite{ChenLLZ22} is based on \raecke trees
and group Steiner tree rounding. The algorithm and analysis also
establishes an upper bound on the integrality gap of an
LP relaxation for Flex-SNDP \cite{ChekuriJ22}.
