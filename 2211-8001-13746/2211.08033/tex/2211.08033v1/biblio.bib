abstract = {In this paper novel optimization models are proposed for planning Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs), where the objective is to minimize the network installation cost while providing full coverage to wireless mesh clients. Our mixed integer linear programming models allow to select the number and positions of mesh routers and access points, while accurately taking into account traffic routing, interference, rate adaptation, and channel assignment. We provide the optimal solutions of three problem formulations for a set of realistic-size instances (with up to 60 mesh devices) and discuss the effect of different parameters on the characteristics of the planned networks. Moreover, we propose and evaluate a relaxation-based heuristic for large-sized network instances which jointly solves the topology/coverage planning and channel assignment problems. Finally, the quality of the planned networks is evaluated under different traffic conditions through detailed system level simulations.}

abstract = {With the severe spectrum shortage in conventional cellular bands, millimeter wave (mmW) frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz have been attracting growing attention as a possible candidate for next-generation micro- and picocellular wireless networks. The mmW bands offer orders of magnitude greater spectrum than current cellular allocations and enable very high-dimensional antenna arrays for further gains via beamforming and spatial multiplexing. This paper uses recent real-world measurements at 28 and 73 GHz in New York, NY, USA, to derive detailed spatial statistical models of the channels and uses these models to provide a realistic assessment of mmW micro- and picocellular networks in a dense urban deployment. Statistical models are derived for key channel parameters, including the path loss, number of spatial clusters, angular dispersion, and outage. It is found that, even in highly non-line-of-sight environments, strong signals can be detected 100-200 m from potential cell sites, potentially with multiple clusters to support spatial multiplexing. Moreover, a system simulation based on the models predicts that mmW systems can offer an order of magnitude increase in capacity over current state-of-the-art 4G cellular networks with no increase in cell density from current urban deployments. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {The rate and energy efficiency of wireless channels can be improved by deploying software-controlled metasurfaces to reflect signals from the source to the destination, especially when the direct path is weak. While previous works mainly optimized the reflections, this letter compares the new technology with classic decode-and-forward (DF) relaying. The main observation is that very high rates and/or large metasurfaces are needed to outperform DF relaying, both in terms of minimizing the total transmit power and maximizing the energy efficiency, which also includes the dissipation in the transceiver hardware.},

@article{Renzo2020,
abstract = {Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are an emerging transmission technology for application to wireless communications. RISs can be realized in different ways, which include (i) large arrays of inexpensive antennas that are usually spaced half of the wavelength apart; and (ii) metamaterial-based planar or conformal large surfaces whose scattering elements have sizes and inter-distances much smaller than the wavelength. Compared with other transmission technologies, e.g., phased arrays, multi-antenna transmitters, and relays, RISs require the largest number of scattering elements, but each of them needs to be backed by the fewest and least costly components. Also, no power amplifiers are usually needed. For these reasons, RISs constitute a promising software-defined architecture that can be realized at reduced cost, size, weight, and power (C-SWaP design), and are regarded as an enabling technology for realizing the emerging concept of smart radio environments (SREs). In this paper, we (i) introduce the emerging research field of RIS-empowered SREs; (ii) overview the most suitable applications of RISs in wireless networks; (iii) present an electromagnetic-based communication-theoretic framework for analyzing and optimizing metamaterial-based RISs; (iv) provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research; and (v) discuss the most important research issues to tackle. Owing to the interdisciplinary essence of RIS-empowered SREs, finally, we put forth the need of reconciling and reuniting C. E. Shannon{\&}{\#}x2019;s mathematical theory of communication with G. Green{\&}{\#}x2019;s and J. C. Maxwell{\&}{\#}x2019;s mathematical theories of electromagnetism for appropriately modeling, analyzing, optimizing, and deploying future wireless networks empowered by RISs.},

To overcome inherent vulnerability to attenuation, 60 GHz radios communicate by forming highly-directional electronically-steerable beams. Standards like IEEE 802.11ad have tailored MAC/PHY protocols to such flexible-beam 60 GHz networks. However, lack of a reconfigurable platform has thwarted a realistic proof-of-concept evaluation. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth measurement of indoor 60 GHz networks using a first-of-its-kind software-radio platform. Our measurement focuses on the link-level behavior with three major perspectives: (i) coverage and bit-rate of a single link, and implications for 60 GHz MIMO; (ii) impact of beam-steering on network performance, particularly under human blockage and device mobility; (iii) spatial reuse between flexible beams. Our study dispels some common myths, and reveals key challenges in maintaining robust flexible-beam connection. We propose new principles that can tackle such challenges based on unique properties of 60 GHz channel and cognitive capability of 60 GHz links.}, journal = {SIGMETRICS Perform. Eval.
