\section{Broader Impact}
\label{appendix:E}
This work is primarily related to understanding and improving self-supervised learning -- a training method for deep neural networks which is able to leverage large amounts of unlabeled data from the internet, making it one of the most used methods for state of the art image and text generative models today \cite{clip, dalle}. Such models have significant broader impact and potential negative consequences which are beyond the scope of this work. We refer readers to discussions of those paper for further information. Specifically, this work aims to improve such SSL techniques, thereby inheriting the broader impact of these models.
