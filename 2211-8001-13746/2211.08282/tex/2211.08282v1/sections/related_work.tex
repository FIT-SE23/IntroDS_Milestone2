\section{Related Work}
Our work is undoubtedly built upon the the large literature base from the fields equivariant deep learning and self-supervised learning as outlined in Sections \ref{sec:introduction} and \ref{sec:background}. Beyond this background, however, out work is highly related in motivation to a number of studies specifically related to equivariance in self-supervised learning. Most prior work, however, has focused on the undesired invariances learned by A-SSL methods \cite{xiao2021what, tsai2022conditional} and developing methods by which to avoid this through learned approximate equivariance \cite{dangovski2022equivariant, wang2021residual}.
