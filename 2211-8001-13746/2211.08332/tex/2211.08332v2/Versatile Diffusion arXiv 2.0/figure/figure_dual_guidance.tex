    \caption{This figure shows image samples created with the dual-guidance of text prompts and reference images (left). Image samples without borders are baseline results generated by ensembling SDv1.4~\cite{ldm} with SD-variation~\cite{sd-justin}. Image samples with green borders are VD's outputs (ours) with attention-level mixing. To fairly compare the performance, samples in one columns have the exact same random seed and thus the same diffusion noises.}
