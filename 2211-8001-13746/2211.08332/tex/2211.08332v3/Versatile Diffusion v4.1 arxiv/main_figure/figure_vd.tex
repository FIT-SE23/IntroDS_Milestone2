        The overall structure of four-flow Versatile Diffusion (VD). Each color line depicts a single flow of VD that represents one supported task (\ie green line for text-to-image). The VAE encoders at the far left are only used in training and are replaced with Gaussian noise inputs during inference. Oppositely, the VAE decoders at the far right are only used in inference for output generation, not train-time loss computation. For simplicity, we hide global layers in this figure. Better viewed in color.}
