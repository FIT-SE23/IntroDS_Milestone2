    \caption{Graphic illustration of one diffusion step of VD's multi-flow multimodal diffusion framework, in which multiple choices of data layers (blue), context layers (green), and fixed global layers (gray) are involved. The black dash line shows one flow of the model that handles one crossmodal task (\ie text-to-image), in which the top data blocks, the bottom context blocks, and the shared global layers are activated.  Other data and context blocks stay silent but will be activated when performing other tasks.}
