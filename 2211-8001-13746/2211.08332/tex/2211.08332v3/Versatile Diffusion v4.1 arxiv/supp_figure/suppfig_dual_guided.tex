    \caption{Additional figures that show the performance of our proposed dual-context blender. The horizontal axis shows the mixing rate we use in these samples: small mixing rates lead to image-focused (to the left), and large mixing rates lead to text-focused (to the right). For each sample, we show three rows, from top to bottom are the results of attention-level mixing, layer-level mixing, and model-level mixing, in which the top row (attention-level mixing) is the best.}
