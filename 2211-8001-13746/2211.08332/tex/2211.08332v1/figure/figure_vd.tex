        The overall structure of our Versatile Diffusion (VD) which solves text-to-image, image-to-text, image-variations, and text-variations in one unified model. Each color line depicts a single flow of VD that represents one supported task (\ie green line for text-to-image). This figure is better viewed in color.}
