    \caption{This figure shows images generated from dual-context blender (one image and one prompt). Images without borders are baseline results generated by ensembling SDv1.4~\cite{ldm} with SD-variation~\cite{sd-justin}. Images with green borders are VD's outputs (ours) with a deeper level of mixing. To fairly compare the performance, samples in the same columns use the same random seed and initial noise inputs.}
