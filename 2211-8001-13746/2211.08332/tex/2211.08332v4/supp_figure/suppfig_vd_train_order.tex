    \caption{A graphic explanation of possible ways of training the generalized VD with $M$ types of context that supports $N$ types of outputs. The green dash box crop out the current VD/VD-Alt mentioned in the main paper and the appendix. VD's training shows the black paths starting from IV (image-variation), while VD-Alt's training shows an altered red path from T2I (text-to-image). }
