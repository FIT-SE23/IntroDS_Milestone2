In this paper, we have presented a probabilistic deep metric learning (PDML) framework to improve the performance of hyperspectral image classification tasks.
We use the Gaussian distribution to model the label uncertainty of the spectral channel in the input patches and employ the Monte-Carlo sampling to generate various training samples from these distributions.
We then impose a probabilistic contrastive loss to enlarge interclass distances and decrease intraclass distances for better discriminative ability of the model.
We have performed diverse experiments on three widely-used hyperspectral datasets to examine the effectiveness of the proposed PDML framework, which achieved the state-of-the-art classification performance as well as enhanced the accuracy of various architectures.
It is interesting to employ the proposed framework in other directions such as object localization, change detection, and segmentation tasks in remote sensing as future works.
