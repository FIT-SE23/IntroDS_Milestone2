Our results indicate that Euclidean regularization leads to faster trajectory convergence rates near \ac{SOS} solutions.
While this does not contradict the analysis of \citet{Nem04} \textendash\ which concerns the method's ergodic average in merely monotone problems and advocates the use of entropic regularization in domains with a favorable geometry \textendash\ it does run contrary to its spirit.

We attribute the source of this discrepancy (at least in the non-sharp case) to the fact that Lipschitz continuity and second-order sufficiency are both norm-based conditions, so it is plausible to expect that norm-based regularizers would lead to better results.
This raises the question of what the corresponding rate analysis would give in the case of Bregman-based variants of \eqref{eq:Lipschitz} and \eqref{eq:strong}, \eg as in the recent works of \citet{BBT17}, \citet{LFN18}, and \citet{ABM19}.
We defer this analysis to future work.
