 abstract = {Asymptotic properties are established for the Robbins-Monro [1] procedure of stochastically solving the equation M(x) = α. Two disjoint cases are treated in detail. The first may be called the "bounded" case, in which the assumptions we make are similar to those in the second case of Robbins and Monro. The second may be called the "quasi-linear" case which restricts M(x) to lie between two straight lines with finite and nonvanishing slopes but postulates only the boundedness of the moments of Y(x) - M(x) (see Sec. 2 for notations). In both cases it is shown how to choose the sequence {an} in order to establish the correct order of magnitude of the moments of xn - θ. Asymptotic normality of a1/2 n(xn - θ) is proved in both cases under a further assumption. The case of a linear M(x) is discussed to point up other possibilities. The statistical significance of our results is sketched.},

abstract = "Closed proper convex functions have many properties in common with differentiable functions such as continuity and one-sided directional derivatives. In this paper it is shown that there exists a mean value theorem for such functions with the gradient vector in the differentiable case replaced by an element of the subdifferential in the convex case. Under compactness of the isoquant sets, (minus) the cost functions are convex and with the theorem above it is easy to show that under incomplete specialization and constant returns to scale the prices of international goods determine uniquely the prices of domestic goods if the isoquant sets are linearly independent."
