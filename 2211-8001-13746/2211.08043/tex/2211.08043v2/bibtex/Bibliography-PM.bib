@article{OCW16,
	abstract = {Abstract Selfish routing, represented by the User-Equilibrium (UE) model, is known to be inefficient when compared to the System Optimum (SO) model. However, there is currently little understanding of how the magnitude of this inefficiency, which can be measured by the Price of Anarchy (PoA), varies across different structures of demand and supply. Such understanding would be useful for both transport policy and network design, as it could help to identify circumstances in which policy interventions that are designed to induce more efficient use of a traffic network, are worth their costs of implementation.  This paper identifies four mechanisms that govern how the PoA varies with travel demand in traffic networks with separable and strictly increasing cost functions. For each OD movement, these are expansions and contractions in the sets of routes that are of minimum cost under UE and minimum marginal total cost under SO. The effects of these mechanisms on the PoA are established via a combination of theoretical proofs and conjectures supported by numerical evidence. In addition, for the special case of traffic networks with BPR-like cost functions having common power, it is proven that there is a systematic relationship between link flows under UE and SO, and hence between the levels of demand at which expansions and contractions occur. For this case, numerical evidence also suggests that the PoA has power law decay for large demand.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we examine the Nash equilibrium convergence properties of no-regret learning in general $B$-player games. For concreteness, we focus on the archetypal "follow the regularized leader" (FTRL) family of algorithms, and we consider the full spectrum of uncertainty that the players may encounter \textendash\ from noisy, oracle-based feedback, to bandit, payoff-based information. In this general context, we establish a comprehensive equivalence between the stability of a Nash equilibrium and its support: \emph{a Nash equilibrium is stable and attracting with arbitrarily high probability if and only if it is strict} (i.e., each equilibrium strategy has a unique best response). This equivalence extends existing continuous-time versions of the ``folk theorem'' of evolutionary game theory to a bona fide algorithmic learning setting, and it provides a clear refinement criterion for the prediction of the day-to-day behavior of no-regret learning in games.},

First, we show that the objective function value either diverges or converges Q-linearly to a limit. Using this result, we show that, in the case of box constraints, the iterates converge to a unique point satisfying first-order and weak second-order optimality conditions, assuming the objective function Hessian Q is rank dominant with respect to the principal submatrices that are maximally positive semidefinite. Such Q include matrices that are positive semidefinite or negative semidefinite or nondegenerate or have negative diagonals. Preliminary numerical experience is reported.},

	abstract = {We analyze stochastic gradient descent for optimizing non-convex functions. In many cases for non-convex functions the goal is to find a reasonable local minimum, and the main concern is that gradient updates are trapped in \em saddle points. In this paper we identify \em strict saddle property for non-convex problem that allows for efficient optimization. Using this property we show that from an \em arbitrary starting point,  stochastic gradient descent converges to a local minimum in a polynomial number of iterations. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that gives \em global convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent on non-convex functions with exponentially many local minima and saddle points. Our analysis can be applied to orthogonal tensor decomposition, which is widely used in learning a rich class of  latent variable models. We propose a new optimization formulation for the tensor decomposition problem that has strict saddle property. As a result we get the first online algorithm for orthogonal tensor decomposition with global convergence guarantee.},

	abstract = {This paper shows that a perturbed form of gradient descent converges to a second-order stationary point in a number iterations which depends only poly-logarithmically on dimension (i.e., it is almost ``dimension-free''). The convergence rate of this procedure matches the well-known convergence rate of gradient descent to first-order stationary points, up to log factors. When all saddle points are non-degenerate, all second-order stationary points are local minima, and our result thus shows that perturbed gradient descent can escape saddle points almost for free. Our results can be directly applied to many machine learning applications, including deep learning. As a particular concrete example of such an application, we show that our results can be used directly to establish sharp global convergence rates for matrix factorization. Our results rely on a novel characterization of the geometry around saddle points, which may be of independent interest to the non-convex optimization community.},

The aim of this HDR dissertation is to examine the ramifications of no-regret learning in multi-agent environments, i.e., when the agents' rewards are determined by their interactions. In this context, a natural question that arises is whether no-regret learning always leads to a rationally admissible states -- such as a Nash equilibrium. We provide a range of answers to this question, both positive and negative, and we examine in detail how these answers are affected by the structure of the underlying game, the information available to the players, the time-scales involved, etc. We also discuss a range of concrete applications to large-scale distributed machine learning problems and multiple-input/multiple-output systems in signal processing.},

@article{HW98,
	abstract = {We generalize the recent relative loss bounds for on-line algorithms where the additional loss of the algorithm on the whole sequence of examples over the loss of the best expert is bounded. The generalization allows the sequence to be partitioned into segments, and the goal is to bound the additional loss of the algorithm over the sum of the losses of the best experts for each segment. This is to model situations in which the examples change and different experts are best for certain segments of the sequence of examples. In the single segment case, the additional loss is proportional to log n, where n is the number of experts and the constant of proportionality depends on the loss function. Our algorithms do not produce the best partition; however the loss bound shows that our predictions are close to those of the best partition. When the number of segments is k+1 and the sequence is of length \&ell, we can bound the additional loss of our algorithm over the best partition by                                                                           {\$}{\$}O{$\backslash$}left( {\{}klogn + k{$\backslash$}log {$\backslash$}left( {\{}{\{}{$\backslash$}ell {$\backslash$}mathord{\{}{$\backslash$}left/ {\{}{$\backslash$}vphantom {\{}{$\backslash$}ell k{\}}{\}} {$\backslash$}right. {$\backslash$}kern-{$\backslash$}nulldelimiterspace{\}} k{\}}{\}} {$\backslash$}right){\}} {$\backslash$}right){\$}{\$}                . For the case when the loss per trial is bounded by one, we obtain an algorithm whose additional loss over the loss of the best partition is independent of the length of the sequence. The additional loss becomes                                                                           {\$}{\$}O{$\backslash$}left( {\{}klogn + k{$\backslash$}log {$\backslash$}left( {\{}{\{}{$\backslash$}ell {$\backslash$}mathord{\{}{$\backslash$}left/ {\{}{$\backslash$}vphantom {\{}{$\backslash$}ell k{\}}{\}} {$\backslash$}right. {$\backslash$}kern-{$\backslash$}nulldelimiterspace{\}} k{\}}{\}} {$\backslash$}right){\}} {$\backslash$}right){\$}{\$}                 , where L is the loss of the best partitionwith k+1 segments. Our algorithms for tracking the predictions of the best expert aresimple adaptations of Vovk's original algorithm for the single best expert case. As in the original algorithms, we keep one weight per expert, and spend O(1) time per weight in each trial.},

	abstract = {The cornerstone underpinning deep learning is the guarantee that gradient descent on an objective converges to local minima. Unfortunately, this guarantee fails in settings, such as generative adversarial nets, where there are multiple interacting losses. The behavior of gradient-based methods in games is not well understood -- and is becoming increasingly important as adversarial and multi-objective architectures proliferate. In this paper, we develop new techniques to understand and control the dynamics in general games. The key result is to decompose the second-order dynamics into two components. The first is related to potential games, which reduce to gradient descent on an implicit function; the second relates to Hamiltonian games, a new class of games that obey a conservation law, akin to conservation laws in classical mechanical systems. The decomposition motivates Symplectic Gradient Adjustment (SGA), a new algorithm for finding stable fixed points in general games. Basic experiments show SGA is competitive with recently proposed algorithms for finding local Nash equilibria in GANs -- whilst at the same time being applicable to -- and having guarantees in -- much more general games.},

@inproceedings{LS19,
	abstract = {Motivated by the pursuit of a systematic computational and algorithmic understanding of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we present a simple yet unified non-asymptotic local convergence theory for smooth two-player games, which subsumes several discrete-time gradient-based saddle point dynamics. The analysis reveals the surprising nature of the off-diagonal interaction term as both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, this interaction term explains the origin of the slow-down effect in the convergence of Simultaneous Gradient Ascent (SGA) to stable Nash equilibria. On the other hand, for the unstable equilibria, exponential convergence can be proved thanks to the interaction term, for four modified dynamics proposed to stabilize GAN training: Optimistic Mirror Descent (OMD), Consensus Optimization (CO), Implicit Updates (IU) and Predictive Method (PM). The analysis uncovers the intimate connections among these stabilizing techniques, and provides detailed characterization on the choice of learning rate. As a by-product, we present a new analysis for OMD proposed in Daskalakis, Ilyas, Syrgkanis, and Zeng [2017] with improved rates.},

	abstract = {We introduce and study a new type of dynamical system which combines the continuous gradient method with a nonlinear Lotka-Volterra (LV) type of differential system within a logarithmic-quadratic proximal scheme. We prove a global existence and viability result for the resulting trajectory which holds for a general smooth function. The asymptotic behavior of the produced trajectory is analyzed and global convergence of the trajectory to a minimizer of the convex minimization problem over the nonnegative orthant is established. The implicit discretization which is at the origin of the proposed continuous dynamical system is an interior proximal scheme for minimizing a closed proper convex function, and convergence results and properties of the resulting discrete scheme are also established. We show finally that the trajectories of the family of regularized Lotka-Volterra systems, parametrized by the positive parameter associated with the quadratic proximal term, are uniformly convergent to the solution of the classical LV-dynamical system, as the parameter associated with the proximal term approaches zero.},

@article{BS00,
	abstract = {It is known that various deterministic and stochastic processes such as asymptotically autonomous differential equations or stochastic approximation processes can be analyzed by relating them to an appropriately chosen semiflow. Here, we introduce the notion of a stochastic process X being a weak asymptotic pseudotrajectory for a semiflow $\Phi$ and are interested in the limiting behavior of the empirical measures of X. The main results are as follows: (1) the weak* limit points of the empirical measures for X axe almost surely $\Phi$-invariant measures; (2) given any semiflow $\Phi$, there exists a weak asymptotic pseudotrajectory X of $\Phi$ such that the set of weak* limit points of its empirical measures almost surely equal the set of all ergodic measures for $\Phi$; and (3) if X is an asymptotic pseudotrajectory for a semiflow $\Phi$, then conditions on $\Phi$ that ensure convergence of the empirical measures are derived.},

	abstract = {External regret compares the performance of an online algorithm, selecting among N actions, to the performance of the best of those actions in hindsight. Internal regret compares the loss of an online algorithm to the loss of a modified online algorithm, which consistently replaces one action by another. In this paper we give a simple generic reduction that, given an algorithm for the external regret problem, converts it to an efficient online algorithm for the internal regret problem. We provide methods that work both in the full information model, in which the loss of every action is observed at each time step, and the partial information (bandit) model, where at each time step only the loss of the selected action is observed. The importance of internal regret in game theory is due to the fact that in a general game, if each player has sublinear internal regret, then the empirical frequencies converge to a correlated equilibrium. For external regret we also derive a quantitative regret bound for a very general setting of regret, which includes an arbitrary set of modification rules (that possibly modify the online algorithm) and an arbitrary set of time selection functions (each giving different weight to each time step). The regret for a given time selection and modification rule is the difference between the cost of the online algorithm and the cost of the modified online algorithm, where the costs are weighted by the time selection function. This can be viewed as a generalization of the previously-studied sleeping experts setting.},

@article{MagSta14,
	abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of efficient resource allocation in dynamic infrastructureless wireless networks. In a reactive interference-limited scenario, at each transmission trial, every transmitter selects a frequency channel from some common pool, together with a power-level. As a result, for all transmitters, not only the fading gain, but also the number and the power of interfering transmissions vary over time. Due to the absence of a central controller and time-varying network characteristics, it is highly inefficient for transmitters to acquire the global channel and network knowledge. Therefore, given no information, each transmitter selfishly gropes to maximize its average reward, which is a function of the channel quality as well as the joint selection profile of all transmitters. This scenario is modeled as an adversarial multi-player multi-armed bandit game, where players attempt to minimize their so-called regret, while at the network side desired is to achieve equilibrium in some sense. Based on this model and in order to solve the resource allocation problem, in this paper we develop two joint power-level and channel selection strategies. We prove that the gap between the average rewards achieved by our approaches and that based on the best fixed strategy converges to zero asymptotically. Moreover, the empirical joint frequencies of the game converge to the set of correlated equilibria, which is characterized for two special cases of the designed game.},

	abstract = {Scope of this paper is to analyse four subcarrier allocation algorithms for multicellular {OFDMA} networks, namely coordinated, sequential, random and an innovative technique of cell splitting, that uses both random and coordinated subcarrier allocation. Common characteristic of these subcarrier allocation algorithms is that they do not require knowledge of channel state information ({CSI}) at the transmitter, a fact that leads to more efficient use of available bandwidth, lower algorithmic complexity and faster decision making. The algorithms are studied for an {OFDMA} multicellular network. Simulation results show that a multicellular {OFDMA} network is able to provide real broadband wireless access, with offered bit rate to reach 20 Mbps per cell, even without {CSI} knowledge.},

@article{DHK12,
	abstract = {We study convergence of distributed protocols for power control in a non-cooperative wireless transmission scenario. There are n wireless communication requests or links that experience interference and noise. To be successful a link must satisfy an {SINR} constraint. Each link is a rational selfish agent that strives to be successful with the least power that is required. A classic approach to this problem is the fixed-point iteration due to Foschini and Miljanic , for which we prove the first bounds on worst-case convergence times - after roughly O(n log n) rounds all {SINR} constraints are nearly satisfied. When agents try to satisfy each constraint exactly, however, links might not be successful at all. For this case, we design a novel framework for power control using regret learning algorithms and iterative discretization. While the exact convergence times must rely on a variety of parameters, we show that roughly a polynomial number of rounds suffices to make every link successful during at least a constant fraction of all previous rounds.},

We present and comment on what we consider are the most fundamental contributions in the area pointing out relationships and differences in approaches and their consequences and applicability. We consider wireless networks as collections of directly interfering wireless links. I.e., we consider single hop configurations, but we do not assume that there is necessarily a centralized control, or a single common goal for the network. We explicitly deal with voice and ``data'' networks, which have differences in perspective that lead to different methodologies.},

	abstract = {This paper presents new distributed power and admission control algorithms for ad-hoc wireless networks in random channel environments. Previous work in this area has focused on distributed control for ad-hoc networks with fixed channels. We show that the algorithms resulting from such formulations do not accurately capture the dynamics of a time-varying channel. The performance of the network in terms of power consumption and generated interference can be severely degraded when power and admission control algorithms that are designed for deterministic channels are applied to random channels. In particular, some well-known optimality results for deterministic channels no longer hold. In order to address these problems we propose a new criterion for power optimality in ad-hoc wireless networks. We then show that the optimal power allocation for this new criterion can be found through an appropriate stochastic approximation algorithm. We also present a modified version of this algorithm for tracking nonstationary equilibria, which allows us to perform admission control. Ultimately, the iterations of the stochastic approximation algorithms can be decoupled to form fully distributed on-line power and admission control algorithms for ad-hoc wireless networks with time-varying channels.},

	abstract = {Fluctuations in the abundance of molecules in the living cell may affect its growth and well being. For regulatory molecules (e.g., signaling proteins or transcription factors), fluctuations in their expression can affect the levels of downstream targets in a network. Here, we develop an analytic framework to investigate the phenomenon of noise correlation in molecular networks. Specifically, we focus on the metabolic network, which is highly interlinked, and noise properties may constrain its structure and function. Motivated by the analogy between the dynamics of a linear metabolic pathway and that of the exactly soluble linear queuing network or, alternatively, a mass transfer system, we derive a plethora of results concerning fluctuations in the abundance of intermediate metabolites in various common motifs of the metabolic network. For all but one case examined, we find the steady-state fluctuation in different nodes of the pathways to be effectively uncorrelated. Consequently, fluctuations in enzyme levels only affect local properties and do not propagate elsewhere into metabolic networks, and intermediate metabolites can be freely shared by different reactions. Our approach may be applicable to study metabolic networks with more complex topologies or protein signaling networks that are governed by similar biochemical reactions. Possible implications for bioinformatic analysis of metabolomic data are discussed.},

	abstract = {We analyze the problem of finding the optimal signal covariance matrix for MIMO multiple access channels by using an approach based on "exponential learning", a novel optimization method which applies more generally to (quasi-)convex problems defined over sets of positive-definite matrices (with or without trace constraints). If the channels are static, the system users converge to a power allocation profile which attains the sum capacity of the channel exponentially fast (in practice, within a few iterations); otherwise, if the channels fluctuate stochastically over time (following e.g. a stationary ergodic process), users converge to a power profile which attains their ergodic sum capacity instead.

An important feature of the algorithm is that its speed can be controlled by tuning the users' learning rate; correspondingly, the algorithm converges within a few iterations even when the number of users and/or antennas per user in the system is large.},

	abstract = {We study repeated games where players use an exponential learning scheme in order to adapt to an ever-changing environment. If the game's payoffs are subject to random perturbations, this scheme leads to a new stochastic version of the replicator dynamics that is quite different from the ``aggregate shocks'' approach of evolutionary game theory. Irrespective of the perturba- tions' magnitude, we find that strategies which are dominated (even iteratively) eventually become extinct and that the game's strict Nash equilibria are stochastically asymptotically stable. We complement our analysis by illustrating these results in the case of congestion games.},

@inproceedings{MBM12,
	abstract = {We analyze the problem of finding the optimal signal covariance matrix for MIMO multiple access channels by using an approach based on "exponential learning", a novel optimization method which applies more generally to (quasi-)convex problems defined over sets of positive-definite matrices (with or without trace constraints). If the channels are static, the system users converge to a power allocation profile which attains the sum capacity of the channel exponentially fast (in practice, within a few iterations); otherwise, if the channels fluctuate stochastically over time (following e.g. a stationary ergodic process), users converge to a power profile which attains their ergodic sum capacity instead.

An important feature of the algorithm is that its speed can be controlled by tuning the users' learning rate; correspondingly, the algorithm converges within a few iterations even when the number of users and/or antennas per user in the system is large.},

@article{PMR11,
	abstract = {The diversification of languages is one of the most interesting facts about language that seek explanation from an evolutionary point of view. Conceptually the question is related to explaining mechanisms of speciation. An argument that prominently figures in evolutionary accounts of language diversification is that it serves the formation of group markers which help to enhance in-group cooperation. In this paper we use the theory of evolutionary games to show that language diversifica- tion on the level of the meaning of lexical items can come about in a perfectly cooperative world solely as a result of the effects of frequency-dependent selection. Importantly, our argument does not rely on some stipulated function of language diversification in some co-evolutionary process, but comes about as an endogenous feature of the model. The model that we propose is an evolutionary language game in the style of Nowak et al. (1999) [The evolutionary language game. J. Theor. Biol. 200, 147--162], which has been used to explain the rise of a signaling system or protolanguage from a prelinguistic environment. Our analysis focuses on the existence of neutrally stable polymorphisms in this model, where, on the level of the population, a signal can be used for more than one concept or a concept can be inferred by more than one signal. Specifically, such states cannot be invaded by a mutation for bidirectionality, that is, a mutation that tries to resolve the existing ambiguity by linking each concept to exactly one signal in a bijective way. However, such states are not resistant against drift between the selectively neutral variants that are present in such a state. Neutral drift can be a pathway for a mutation for bidirectionality that was blocked before but that finally will take over the population. Different directions of neutral drift open the door for a mutation for bidirectionality to appear on different resident types. This mechanism---which can be seen as a form of shifting balance---can explain why a word can acquire a different meaning in two languages that go back to the same common ancestral language, thereby contributing to the splitting of these two languages. Examples from currently spoken languages, for instance, English clean and its German cognate klein with the meaning of ``small,'' are provided.},

When the channels are static, we show that this game possesses a unique equilibrium; moreover, if the network's users follow a distributed learning scheme based on the replicator dynamics of evolutionary game theory, then they converge to equilibrium exponentially fast. On the other hand, if the channels fluctuate stochastically over time, the associated game still admits a unique equilibrium, but the learning process is not deterministic; just the same, by employing the theory of stochastic approximation, we find that users still converge to equilibrium. Our theoretical analysis hinges on a novel result which is of independent interest: in finite-player games which admit a (possibly nonlinear) convex potential, the replicator dynamics converge to an $\eps$-neighborhood of an equilibrium in time $O(\log(1/\eps))$.},

The stable states of these dynamics coincide with the network's (Wardrop) equilibrium points and we find that they form a convex polytope whose dimension is determined by the network's degeneracy index (an important concept which measures the overlap of the users' paths). Still, despite this abundance of stable states, we find that (almost) every solution trajectory converges to an equilibrium point at an exponential rate. On the other hand, a major challenge occurs when network latencies fluctuate unpredictably due to random exogenous factors. In that case, we show that the time-average of the traffic flows of sufficiently patient users is still concentrated in a neighborhood of evolutionarily stable equilibria and we estimate analytically the corresponding stationary distribution and convergence times.},

@phdthesis{MyThesis,
	abstract = {As far as complex organisms go, the Internet is a textbook specimen: its billions of man-made components might be relatively simple to understand on an individual basis, but the complexity of their interactions far outstrips the deductive capabilities of their creators. As a result, a promising way to analyze these interactions is provided by game theory, a discipline devoted to the (often chimeric) task of making sense of an even more obscure and complex entity, human rationality. Nevertheless, this inherent goal of game theory is also the source of a fundamental controversy: is it really possible to apply our understanding of human interactions and behavioral patterns to networks of machines, devoid as they are of the feelings and irrational drives that characterize the former?

The way out of this impasse is to recall that game theory encompasses the study of ``rationality'' in its most abstract form, even when confronted with entities that have little or no capacity for rational thought (e.g. animals, bacteria, or, in our case, computers). This line of reasoning has led to the emergence of evolutionary game theory (EGT), an offshoot of game theory which is concerned with large populations of barely sentient species that interact with each other in competitive habitats that promote natural selection. As such, evolutionary methods appear particularly attractive as a means to understand the inner workings of communication networks: after all, it is a rare occasion when Internet users do not compete with one another for the resources of the network they live in.
Perhaps the most well-studied model of population evolution in this context is that of the replicator dynamics, a dynamical system first introduced by Taylor and Jonker (1978) to study the interactions of different phenotypes within biological species. These studies quickly attracted the interest of game theorists and, after about a decade, eventually culminated in the ``folk theorem'' of EGT, a theorem which links evolution and rationality by showing that what appears as the consequence of rational thought is, in fact, the byproduct of natural selection favoring the survival of the ``fittest''.

On the other hand, if rationality can be construed as the outcome of an evo- lutionary process, then, by providing appropriate selection criteria, evolution can also be steered to any state which is efficient with respect to these criteria. In this way, the replicator dynamics take on a different guise, that of a learning mechanism which the users of a network might employ in order to reach a ``socially efficient'' steady state; put differently, by manipulating the incentives of the ``players'', the designers of the ``game'' can guide them to whatever state suits their purpose.

The main issue that this dissertation seeks to address is what happens if, in addition to the interactions between the players of a game (e.g. the users of a network), the situation is exacerbated by the interference of an assortment of exogenous and unpredictable factors, commonly referred to as ``nature''. We find that this random interference differentiates crucially between the evolutionary and learning approaches, leading to different (stochastic) versions of the replicator dynamics.

Rather surprisingly, in the case of learning, we find that many aspects of rationality remain unperturbed by the effects of noise: regardless of the fluctuations' magnitude, players are still able to identify suboptimal actions, something which is not always possible in the evolutionary setting. Even more to the point, the ``strict (Nash) equilibria'' of the game (an important class of steady states) turns out to be stochastically stable and attracting, again irrespective of the noise level.

From the viewpoint of network theory (where stochastic perturbations are, quite literally, omnipresent), the importance of these results is that they guarantee the robustness of the replicator dynamics against the advent of noise. In this way, if the users of a stochastically fluctuating network adhere to a replicator learning scheme and are patient enough, we show that the flow of traffic in the network converges to an invariant (stationary) distribution which is sharply concentrated in a neighborhood of the network's equilibrium point.},

	abstract = {Using a large deviations approach we calculate the probability distribution of the mutual information of MIMO channels in the limit of large antenna numbers. In contrast to previous methods that only focused to the distribution close to its most probable value, thus obtaining an asymptotically Gaussian distribution, we calculate the full distribution including its tails, which behave quite differently from the bulk of the distribution. Our resulting probability distribution seamlessly interpolates between the Gaussian approximation for rates R close to the ergodic value of the mutual information and the approach of Zheng and Tse, valid for large signal to noise ratios $\rho$. This provides us with a tool to analytically calculate outage probabilities at any point in the $(R, \rho,N)$ parameter space, as long as the number of antennas N is not too small. In addition, this method also yields the probability distribution of eigenvalues constrained in the subspace where the mutual information per antenna is fixed to R for a given $\rho$. Quite remarkably, this eigenvalue density is of the form of the Marcenko-Pastur distribution with square-root singularities.},

@article{KMMC11,
	abstract = {Using a large deviations approach we calculate the probability distribution of the mutual information of MIMO channels in the limit of large antenna numbers. In contrast to previous methods that only focused at the distribution close to its mean (thus obtaining an asymptotically Gaussian distribution), we calculate the full distribution, including its tails which strongly deviate from the Gaussian behavior near the mean. The resulting distribution interpolates seamlessly between the Gaussian approximation for rates $R$ close to the ergodic value of the mutual information and the approach of Zheng and Tse for large Signal-to-Noise Ratios $\rho$. This calculation provides us with a tool to obtain outage probabilities analytically at any point in the $(R,\rho,N)$ parameter space, as long as the number of antennas N is not too small. In addition, this method also yields the probability distribution of eigenvalues constrained in the subspace where the mutual information per antenna is fixed to $R$ for a given $\rho$. Quite remarkably, this eigenvalue density is of the form of the Marcenko-Pastur distribution with square-root singularities, and it depends on the values of $R$ and $\rho$.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of handover between two coexisting wireless standards and the consequent exploitation of the offered diversity by the use of multi-standard terminals has been dis- cussed. The potential capacity benefits of mobile-initiated vertical handovers are substantial. However, it is important to choose the correct VHO criteria in order to achieve optimum load balancing and equilibrium states (global and social). Two fast-handover schemes are presented, which exhibit fast convergence to the socially optimal states by allowing a subset of the necessary VHOs among the AIs. In all cases the scheme with replicator dynamics, had the best performance at the cost of an increased vertical handover rate.},

	abstract = {We investigate the behavior of a large number of selfish users that are able to switch dynamically between multiple wireless access-points (possibly belonging to different standards) by introducing an iterated non-cooperative game. Users start out completely uneducated and na ̈ıve but, by using a fixed set of strategies to process a broadcasted training signal, they quickly evolve and converge to an evolutionarily stable equilibrium. Then, in order to measure efficiency in this steady state, we adapt the notion of the price of anarchy to our setting and we obtain an explicit analytic estimate for it by using methods from statistical physics (namely the theory of replicas). Surprisingly, we find that the price of anarchy does not depend on the specifics of the wireless nodes (e.g. spectral efficiency) but only on the number of strategies per user and a particular combination of the number of nodes, the number of users and the size of the training signal. Finally, we map this game to the well-studied minority game, generalizing its analysis to an arbitrary number of choices.},

	abstract = {We introduce and analyse the simplex game, a non--cooperative game between selfish heterogeneous players with bounded rationality that compete for limited resources. In this game, players are asked to place their bet among a set of B choices and the game rewards those in the minority. Players start out completely uneducated and naive but, through a selfish learning scheme that seeks to maximise their own gain, they become more experienced and quickly learn to adapt and perform with an unexpected efficiency. Employing methods of Statistical Physics (namely the theory of replicas) we establish explicit analytic estimates of the game's performance that clearly reflect the users' emergent efficiency. We further map the general simplex game to the minority game, a simple model introduced in the context of econophysics. This mapping allows us to study the effect that the number of choices has on the game's performance. For concreteness, our analysis has focused on a system of WLAN access points, but it can be customised to other networks with non-cooperative players, such as OFDMA.},

	abstract = {We investigate the emergence of rationality in repeated games where, at each iteration, the players' payoffs are randombly perturbed (to account e.g. for the effects of fading or errors in the reading of one's throughput). We see that even if players start out completely uneducated about the game, there is a simple learning scheme that enables them to eventually weed out the noise and identify suboptimal choices, regardless of the noise level. More precisely, we show that strategies that are strictly dominated (even iteratively) become extinct in the long run, i.e. players exhibit rational behavior. As an application, we model a number of users that are able to switch dynamically between multiple wireless nodes and see that they are able to pick up which node works best for them, even in the presence of high performance fluctuations.},

	abstract = {We discuss the dynamics of user handover between two coexisting wireless service providers and analyze the consequent exploitation of the offered diversity by the use of multi-standard terminals. We show that the potential capacity benefits of mobile-initiated vertical handovers (VHO) are substantial, but it is important to choose the correct VHO criteria in order to achieve optimum load balancing and equilibrium states (both globally and socially). A fast-handover scheme, based on replicator dynamics is presented, which exhibits fast convergence to the socially optimal states by allowing only a subset of the necessary VHOs among the air interfaces to take place.},
