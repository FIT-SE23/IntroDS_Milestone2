   abstract = {According to the standard model of cosmology, the early universe was dominated by radiation or nonrelativistic matter in several eras of its history. However, many cosmological calculations involving particle processes commonly use Minkowskian results; although, for more precise treatment, quantum field theory in curved spacetime is needed. This paper aims to fill this gap by presenting decay rates for matter and radiation dominated universes in this more precise treatment. We provide a study of the average decay rates for a process where a conformally coupled massive scalar field decays into massless scalar particles. It is found that the presence of a curved spacetime modifies the Minkowskian result considerably for early times but asymptotically only by an additive term proportional to the inverse of the mass and interaction time. Thus, the correction is small for large time scales, but on the time scales of the order of m∼t, the relative correction term may be of importance.},

By studying mutually interacting quantum fields, the decay rates can be calculated on a given spacetime. This paper presents the calculation of the transition probability for the decay of a massive scalar particle in a stiff-matter-dominated universe. We find that, due to the presence of a gravitational field, a finite correction to the transition probability is added which depends inversely on the mass. Moreover, the decay rate is smaller, and lifetime of the particles is longer compared to flat space. The mass dependence is such that the lifetime of lighter particles is prolonged more compared to heavier particles. This result may be of significance when studying cosmological situations involving stiff matter.},

   abstract = {The lack of energy conservation introduces new particle processes in curved spacetime that are forbidden in flat space. Therefore, one has to be very cautious about using the results calculated in Minkowskian space in early Universe applications. This is true for particle decay rates in particular, which need to be calculated using quantum field theory in curved spacetime. Previous studies are usually restricted to using minimal or conformal coupling for the decaying particle, while using a more general coupling would give deeper insight into particle decay. This paper presents the results we obtained for a massive particle decaying in a general power-law universe with arbitrary coupling to gravity. We find that, depending on the value of the gravitational coupling, the effect of gravitation may either strengthen or weaken the decay. The analysis further reveals that, apart from radiation-dominated universe, there are values of the coupling constant for which the decay rate is exactly Minkowskian for all universe types. Because the decay rate may be considerably modified in curved space, these issues need to be considered when doing precise cosmological calculations.},

The first part of the paper is a numerical study of finite causal sets sprinkled into Alexandrov subsets of Minkowski spacetime of dimensions 1+1, 1+2 and 1+3. In particular we consider the rank 2 past of sprinkled causet events, which is the set of events that are two links to the past. Assigning one of the rank 2 past events as "preferred past"for each event yields a "preferred past structure,"which was recently proposed as the basis for a causal set d'Alembertian. We test six criteria for selecting rank 2 past subsets. One criterion performs particularly well at uniquely selecting - with very high probability - a preferred past satisfying desirable properties. The second part of the paper concerns (infinite) sprinkled causal sets for general spacetime manifolds. After reviewing the construction of the sprinkling process with the Poisson measure, we consider various specific applications. Among other things, we compute the probability of obtaining a sprinkled causal set of a given isomorphism class by combinatorial means, using a correspondence between causal sets in Alexandrov subsets of 1+1 dimensional Minkowski spacetime and 2D-orders. These methods are also used to compute the expected size of the past infinity as a proportion of the total size of a sprinkled causal set.},

   abstract = {The process of quantum measurement is considered in the algebraic framework of quantum field theory on curved spacetimes. Measurements are carried out on one quantum field theory, the “system”, using another, the “probe”. The measurement process involves a dynamical coupling of “system” and “probe” within a bounded spacetime region. The resulting “coupled theory” determines a scattering map on the uncoupled combination of the “system” and “probe” by reference to natural “in” and “out” spacetime regions. No specific interaction is assumed and all constructions are local and covariant. Given any initial state of the probe in the “in” region, the scattering map determines a completely positive map from “probe” observables in the “out” region to “induced system observables”, thus providing a measurement scheme for the latter. It is shown that the induced system observables may be localized in the causal hull of the interaction coupling region and are typically less sharp than the probe observable, but more sharp than the actual measurement on the coupled theory. Post-selected states conditioned on measurement outcomes are obtained using Davies–Lewis instruments that depend on the initial probe state. Composite measurements involving causally ordered coupling regions are also considered. Provided that the scattering map obeys a causal factorization property, the causally ordered composition of the individual instruments coincides with the composite instrument; in particular, the instruments may be combined in either order if the coupling regions are causally disjoint. This is the central consistency property of the proposed framework. The general concepts and results are illustrated by an example in which both “system” and “probe” are quantized linear scalar fields, coupled by a quadratic interaction term with compact spacetime support. System observables induced by simple probe observables are calculated exactly, for sufficiently weak coupling, and compared with first order perturbation theory.},

   abstract = {In order to have well defined rules for the perturbative calculation of quantities of interest in an interacting quantum field theory in curved spacetime, it is necessary to construct Wick polynomials and their time ordered products for the noninteracting theory. A construction of these quantities has recently been given by Brunetti, Fre-denhagen, and Köhler, and by Brunetti and Fredenhagen, but they did not impose any "locality" or "covariance" condition in their constructions. As a consequence, their construction of time ordered products contained ambiguities involving arbitrary functions of spacetime point rather than arbitrary parameters. In this paper, we construct an "extended Wick polynomial algebra"-large enough to contain the Wick polynomials and their time ordered products-by generalizing a construction of Dütsch and Fredenhagen to curved spacetime. We then define the notion of a local, covariant quantum field, and seek a definition of local Wick polynomials and their time ordered products as local, covariant quantum fields. We introduce a new notion of the scaling behavior of a local, covariant quantum field, and impose scaling requirements on our local Wick polynomials and their time ordered products as well as certain additional requirements-such as commutation relations with the free field and appropriate continuity properties under variations of the spacetime metric. For a given polynomial order in powers of the field, we prove that these conditions uniquely determine the local Wick polynomials and their time ordered products up to a finite number of parameters. (These parameters correspond to the usual renormalization ambiguities occurring in Minkowski spacetime together with 1 additional parameters corresponding to the coupling of the field to curvature.) We also prove existence of local Wick polynomials. However, the issue of existence of local time ordered products is deferred to a future investigation. 2},

In order to generalize the formulation of quantum field theory to arbitrary globally hyperbolic curved spacetimes, it is essential that the theory be formulated in an entirely local and covariant manner, without assuming the presence of a preferred state. We propose a new framework for quantum field theory, in which the existence of an Operator Product Expansion (OPE) is elevated to a fundamental status, and, in essence, all of the properties of the quantum field theory are determined by its OPE. We provide general axioms for the OPE coefficients of a quantum field theory. These include a local and covariance assumption (implying that the quantum field theory is locally and covariantly constructed from the spacetime metric), a microlocal spectrum condition, an "associativity" condition, and the requirement that the coefficient of the identity in the OPE of the product of a field with its adjoint have positive scaling degree. We prove curved spacetime versions of the spin-statistics theorem and the PCT theorem. Some potentially significant further implications of our new viewpoint on quantum field theory are discussed.},

Extraordinary non-Hermitian phenomena, ranging from the non-Hermitian skin effect to the supersensitivity to boundary conditions, have been widely explored. Whereas these intriguing phenomena have been considered peculiar to non-Hermitian systems, we show that they can be naturally explained by a duality between non-Hermitian models in flat spaces and their counterparts, which could be Hermitian, in curved spaces. For instance, prototypical one-dimensional (1D) chains with uniform chiral tunnelings are equivalent to their duals in two-dimensional (2D) hyperbolic spaces with or without magnetic fields, and non-uniform tunnelings could further tailor local curvatures. Such a duality unfolds deep geometric roots of non-Hermitian phenomena, delivers an unprecedented routine connecting Hermitian and non-Hermitian physics, and gives rise to a theoretical perspective reformulating our understandings of curvatures and distance. In practice, it provides experimentalists with a powerful two-fold application, using non-Hermiticity to engineer curvatures or implementing synthetic curved spaces to explore non-Hermitian quantum physics.},

The conventional approach is to retain the foundational principles of QT, such as the superposition principle, and modify GR. This is referred to as 'quantizing gravity', resulting in a theory of 'quantum gravity'. The opposite approach is 'gravitizing QT' where we attempt to keep the principles of GR, such as the equivalence principle, and consider how this leads to modifications of QT. What we are most lacking in understanding which route to take, if either, is experimental guidance. Here we consider using a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) to search for clues. In particular, we study how a single BEC in a superposition of two locations could test a gravitizing QT proposal where wavefunction collapse emerges from a unified theory as an objective process, resolving the measurement problem of QT. Such a modification to QT due to general relativistic principles is testable near the Planck mass scale, which is much closer to experiments than the Planck length scale where quantum, general relativistic effects are traditionally anticipated in quantum gravity theories. Furthermore, experimental tests of this proposal should be simpler to perform than recently suggested experiments that would test the quantizing gravity approach in the Newtonian gravity limit by searching for entanglement between two massive systems that are both in a superposition of two locations.},

It is applied to a portion of two-dimensional flat space-time equipped with a non-Cartesian space-time coordinate system with respect to which the metric is nonetheless static. The resulting particle interpretation of the field is shown to be different from the standard one in special-relativistic free-field theory. The ambiguity frustrates an attempt to define uniquely the energy-momentum tensor by the usual method of normal ordering. We discuss various suggestions for (1) distinguishing a unique correct quantization in a given physical situation, or (2) reinterpreting seemingly inequivalent theories as physically equivalent. In passing it is shown that the vacuum state and the energy density of a free field in a box with periodic boundary conditions differ from those associated with a region of the same size in infinite space; this result should be of interest outside the gravitational context.},

The *-algebra of quantum operators is constructed ex­ plicitly and the problem of finding its *-representation is reduced to th a t of selecting a suitable complex structure on the real vector space of the solutions of the (classical) Klein-Gordon equation. Since, in a static space-time, there already exists, a satisfactory quantum field theory, in this case one already knows w hat the ' correct ' complex structure is. A physical characterization of this * correct ' complex structure is obtained. This characterization is used to extend quantum field theory to non­ static space-times. Stationary space-times are considered first. In this case, the issue of extension is completely straightforward and the resulting theory is the natural generalization of the one in static space-times. Gen­ eral, non-stationary space-times are then considered. In this case the issue of extension is quite complicated and we only present a plausible exten­ sion. Although the resulting framework is well-defined mathematically, the physical interpretation associated with it is rather unconventional. Merits and weaknesses of this framework are discussed. 1.

Fix a space-time (Jf,<7a6).1f For simplicity, we shall restrict ourselves to (the minimally coupled) Klein-Gordon fields on this space-time, i.e. to scalar fields 0 on M which satisfy Va Va 0-/t20 = 0, where Va is the derivative operator on (M ,gab) and / ii s a fixed real number. To obtain a quantum description of these fields, we m ust construct a Hilbert space of states, a *-algebra of operators, and introduce a rule for dynamics. As is now well known, the construction of the *-algebra (of field operators) itself is quite straightforward. Hence, it is convenient to use an algebraic approach; i.e. to first construct, abstractly, the *-algebra, and then try to obtain the Hilbert space by choosing an appropriate representation of this *-algebra.

When the field is massless and conformally coupled, we adopt Page's approximation to the renormalized stress-energy tensor, while for massive fields we adopt a modified version of the DeWitt-Schwinger approximation. The latter approximation must be modified so that it possesses the correct renormalization freedom required to ensure the semiclassical equations are consistent. Equipped with these approximations, the reduced-order field equations are easily integrated and the first-order (in) corrections to the metric are obtained. We also compute the corrections to the black hole event horizon, surface gravity, and minimum temperature as well as corrections to the photon sphere and quadratic curvature invariants. We pay particular attention to the temperature profiles of the semiclassical black holes compared with their classical counterparts, pointing out some interesting qualitative features produced by the backreaction.

We consider a minimally-coupled massless quantum scalar field, in both Hartle-Hawking and Unruh states, the latter corresponding to an evaporating BH. The near-extremal domain lends itself to an analytical treatment which sheds light on the behavior of various quantities on approaching extremality. We explore the behavior of the three near-IH flux quantities Tuu-renU, Tvv-renU, and Tuu-renH=Tvv-renH, as a function of the small parameter Δ1-(Q/M)2 (where the superscript "U"or "H"respectively refers to the Unruh or Hartle-Hawking state and "-"refers to the IH value). We find that in the near-extremal domain Tuu-renU≅Tuu-renH=Tvv-renH behaves as Δ5. In contrast, Tvv-renU behaves as Δ4, and we calculate the prefactor analytically. It therefore follows that the semiclassical fluxes at the IH neighborhood of an evaporating near-extremal spherical charged BH are dominated by the influx TvvrenU. In passing, we also find an analytical expression for the transmission coefficient outside a Reissner-Nordström BH to leading order in small frequencies (which turns out to be a crucial ingredient of our near-extremal analysis).

@article{Pla2021,
	abstract = {Solutions to the backreaction equation in 1+1-dimensional semiclassical electrodynamics are obtained and analyzed when considering a time-varying homogeneous electric field initially generated by a classical electric current, coupled to either a quantized scalar field or a quantized spin-12 field. Particle production by way of the Schwinger effect leads to backreaction effects that modulate the electric field strength. Details of the particle production process are investigated along with the transfer of energy between the electric field and the particles. The validity of the semiclassical approximation is also investigated using a criterion previously implemented for chaotic inflation and, in an earlier form, semiclassical gravity. The criterion states that the semiclassical approximation will break down if any linearized gauge-invariant quantity constructed from solutions to the linear response equation, with finite nonsingular data, grows rapidly for some period of time. Approximations to homogeneous solutions of the linear response equation are computed and it is found that the criterion is violated when the maximum value, Emax, obtained by the electric field is of the order of the critical scale for the Schwinger effect, Emax∼Ecritm2/q, where m is the mass of the quantized field and q is its electric charge. For these approximate solutions the criterion appears to be satisfied in the extreme limits qEmaxm2 1 and qEmaxm2≫1.},

@article{Meda2021b,
	abstract = {We prove existence and uniqueness of solutions of the semiclassical Einstein equation in flat cosmological spacetimes driven by a quantum massive scalar field with arbitrary coupling to the scalar curvature. In the semiclassical approximation, the backreaction of matter to curvature is taken into account by equating the Einstein tensor to the expectation values of the stress-energy tensor in a suitable state. We impose initial conditions for the scale factor at finite time, and we show that a regular state for the quantum matter compatible with these initial conditions can be chosen. Contributions with derivative of the coefficient of the metric higher than the second are present in the expectation values of the stress-energy tensor and the term with the highest derivative appears in a non-local form. This fact forbids a direct analysis of the semiclassical equation, and in particular, standard recursive approaches to approximate the solution fail to converge. In this paper, we show that, after partial integration of the semiclassical Einstein equation in cosmology, the non-local highest derivative appears in the expectation values of the stress-energy tensor through the application of a linear unbounded operator which does not depend on the details of the chosen state. We prove that an inversion formula for this operator can be found, furthermore, the inverse happens to be more regular than the direct operator and it has the form of a retarded product, hence, causality is respected. The found inversion formula applied to the traced Einstein equation has thus the form of a fixed point equation. The proof of local existence and uniqueness of the solution of the semiclassical Einstein equation is then obtained applying the Banach fixed point theorem.},

@article{Bernardo2021,
	abstract = {We study inflationary dynamics using a recently introduced classical-quantum correspondence for investigating the backreaction of a quantum mechanical degree of freedom to a classical background. Using specifically a coupled Einstein–Klein–Gordon system, an approximation that holds well during the very early inflationary era when modes are very deep inside the Hubble horizon, we show that the backreaction of a mode of the quantum field will renormalize the Hubble parameter only if the mode’s wavelength is longer than some threshold Planckian length scale. Otherwise, the mode will destabilize the inflationary era. We also present an approximate analytical solution that supports the existence of such short-wavelength threshold and compare the results of the classical-quantum correspondence with the traditional perturbative-iterative method in semiclassical gravity.},

This simple problem has the advantage of combining immediate physical applicability (e.g., resistive damping or maser amplification of a single electromagnetic cavity mode) with a significant idealization of the complex problems encountered in many-particle and relativistic field theory. Successive sections contain discussions of the oscillator subjected to external forces, the oscillator loosely coupled to the external system, an improved treatment of this problem and, finally, there is a brief account of a general formulation.},

@article{Birrell1979b,
	abstract = {The effects of self-interaction on quantum particle creation in cosmological models is investigated. The particular models which are considered are that of a scalar field with an interaction Lagrangian of the form 6pI =-A@ and that of an electromagnetic field with an interaction of the form 55'1 = b,(F,,F"")2 + ~Q(*F,,P")~. In lowest order in the coupling constants, these self-interactions will give rise to the creation of particles in both pairs and in quartets. The contribution which these particles make to the total energy density and pressure of created particles is calculated. It is shown that in general the corrections to these quantities due to the interaction is linear (rather than quadratic) in the coupling constant. The one loop divergences which arise in pair creation are analysed, and the problemof removing them by regularization and renormalization is considered. Estimates are given in particular models for the magnitude of the particle creation arising from self-interaction.},
