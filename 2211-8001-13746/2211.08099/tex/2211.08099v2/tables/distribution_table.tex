    The accuracy of UD discriminating real data and generated data. We feed UD with a real sample $x$ from the real-world data distribution, and a sample $x'$ from manual generation or model-based generation. 
    If UD assigns higher score to $x$ than $x'$ (i.e., $D(x)>D(x')$), it is considered an accurate prediction.
