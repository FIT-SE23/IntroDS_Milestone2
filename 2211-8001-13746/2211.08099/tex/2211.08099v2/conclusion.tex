\section{Conclusions}
Universal Discriminator is a discriminating model for predicting whether a sample comes from the true data distribution, which is a new formulation for all discriminative NLP tasks. Experiments show that UD sets the new state-of-the-art for zero-shot generalization on many benchmarks. UD is high-performing with minimal prompting, and thus is more robust and applicable in practice. A generalized UD can also solve generative tasks at the same time which keeps UD's advantage on discriminative tasks and has comparable performance on generative tasks.
