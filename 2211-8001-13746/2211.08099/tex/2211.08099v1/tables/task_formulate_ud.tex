\caption{Examples of how we unify discriminative tasks. The underlined text represents additional words not present in raw inputs. Note that this is just our implementation of the UD formulation and there can be other ways of task formulation under the UD framework. Some tasks can either be yes/no tasks or multi-choice tasks, depending on how options are provided.}
