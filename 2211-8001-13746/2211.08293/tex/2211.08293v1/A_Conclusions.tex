\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:A}
The ATLAS EventIndex was designed to hold the catalogue of all ATLAS events in advance of LHC Run 2 in 2012-2013, and all system components were developed and deployed in their first implementation as described in this paper by the start of Run 2 in 2015. As any software project, it went through several stages of development and optimisation through the years. Thanks to the partitioned project architecture, each new component version could be tested in parallel with the production version and phased in when its performance was considered stable, and better than the previous version. The EventIndex operation and performance during and after the LHC Run 2 period has been satisfactory.

The significant increases in the data rates expected in LHC Run 3 and the subsequent HL-LHC runs require a transition now to a new technology for the main EventIndex data store. A new prototype based on HBase event tables and queries through Apache Phoenix has been tested and shows encouraging results. A good table schema was designed and the basic functionality is ready. We are now working towards improved performance and better interfaces, with the aim to have the refactored system in operation in advance of the start of LHC Run 3 in 2022.
According to our expectations, this system will be able to withstand the data production rates foreseen for LHC Run 4 and beyond.
