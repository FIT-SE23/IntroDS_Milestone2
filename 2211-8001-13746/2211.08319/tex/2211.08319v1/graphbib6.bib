	Abstract = {The motivation of this work is an inverse problem for the acoustic wave equation, where an array of sensors probes an unknown medium with pulses and measures the scattered waves. The goal of the inversion is to determine from these measurements the structure of the scattering medium, modeled by a spatially varying acoustic impedance function. Many inversion algorithms assume that the mapping from the unknown impedance to the scattered waves is approximately linear. The linearization, known as the Born approximation, is not accurate in strongly scattering media, where the waves undergo multiple reflections before they reach the sensors in the array. Thus, the reconstructions of the impedance have numerous artifacts. The main result of the paper is a novel, linear-algebraic algorithm that uses a reduced order model (ROM) to map the data to those corresponding to the single scattering (Born) model. The ROM construction is based only on the measurements at the sensors in the array. The ROM is a proxy for the wave propagator operator, that propagates the wave in the unknown medium over the duration of the time sampling interval. The output of the algorithm can be input into any off-the-shelf inversion software that incorporates state of the art linear inversion algorithms to reconstruct the unknown acoustic impedance.},

	Abstract = {In recent years, spectral clustering has become one of the most popular modern clustering algorithms. It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.},
