Why do the entrances have varying angles before leading to the court? How do the Barageel (airshafts and wind towers) work? And why do the Majlis (guest's room) have a specific treatment and are located so close to the entrance? What is the purpose of using multiple decorated openings in living rooms or bedrooms?. The architecture of these buildings has been designed and built to cater to people specifically within a culture and its environment; the details of this society are reflected in the features of buildings. This paper aims to explore the main aspects of the architectural shape of traditional buildings in the Gulf area and particularly in the United Arab Emirates.},

abstract = {This work provides compact representations for single- and multi-robot motion planning in the context of prehensile robot manipulation. This work describes the asymptotic near-optimality and probabilistic near-optimality properties of these planners. Probabilistic near-optimality is leveraged to provide practical and grounded stopping criteria for these methods which probabilistically guarantee the methods return high-quality paths. It is also shown how these methods can be leveraged to produce a compact planning representation, which is a lightweight structure that is quick to query and easy to store. The work also outlines a compact representation for solving multi-arm manipulation tasks, and integrates a scalable, asymptotically optimal multi-robot motion planning method to provide scalable, globally asymptotically optimal task and motion planning in manipulation domains.},

@article{Murphy2015,
abstract = {Emissions in the shipping industry are a major environmental concern and IMO regulations are increasingly stringent. Existing methods to assess marine exhaust gas emissions require large and specialised input data-sets. There is therefore a requirement for a methodology which can resolve the dilemma of estimating time-varying gas properties with sufficient accuracy to, for example, predict NOX emissions, whilst also being applicable across the variety of engine types and operational modes that prevail in the marine context, for which there is often sparse input data. In this paper, the influence upon thermal efficiency and the prediction of gas temperature time-histories of differing levels of sophistication in modelled gas properties and composition models is therefore evaluated, as is the effect of modelling engine losses. Using the results of this study, a coupled dynamic-thermodynamic engine simulation in the time-domain is developed, capable of modelling engine performance across the full range of operational conditions (speed and load), including part-load and transient conditions. The simulation is validated against the Otto cycle and through simulations of experimental engine data, the model is shown to successfully predict actual engine performance across a range of engine load conditions.},

abstract = {Computer simulation for buildings has become affordable and possible in both research and industry during the last decades with rapid progress of computer industry as well as fundamental advancement of computational techniques. This paper provides an overview of such advancements achieved between 1987 and 2014, during which Professor Branko Todorovich served as Editor in Chief of Energy and Buildings Journal. The review, however, was not restricted to this journal only, in order to provide a fair snapshot on overall technique advances. Simulation and computational techniques cover a variety of aspects of building. This paper focuses specifically on six different topics including ventilation performance prediction, whole building energy and thermal load simulation, lighting and daylighting modeling, building information modeling, indoor acoustic simulation, and life cycle analysis of buildings. Major advances in each area are highlighted, as well as the trends for development and application.},

abstract = {A zero-dimensional, one zone model of engine cycle for steady-state regimes of engines and a simplified procedure for indicator diagrams analysis have been developed at the Laboratory for internal combustion engines, fuels and lubricants of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering in Kragujevac. In addition to experimental research, thermodynamic modeling of working process of diesel engine with direct injection has been presented in this paper. The simplified procedure for indicator diagrams analysis has been applied, also. The basic problem, a selection of shape parameters of double Vibe function used for modeling the engine operation process, has been solved. The influence of biodiesel fuel and engine working regimes on the start of combustion, combustion duration and shape parameter of double Vibe was determined by a least square fit of experimental heat release curve.},

The prevalent trends in this development are outlined with particular focus on the most frequently used alternative fuels in diesel engines; the properties of various type of biodiesel and the concurrent improvement of diesel engine characteristics using numeric optimization alongside current investigation and research work in the field. Following of a short overview of engine control, aftertreatment and alternative fuels, Green Diesel Engine explores the effects of biodiesel usage on injection, fuel spray, combustion, and tribology characteristics, and engine performance. Additionally, optimization procedures of diesel engine characteristics are discussed using practical examples and each topic is corroborated and supported by current research and detailed illustrations. This thorough discussion provides a solid foundation in the current research but also a starting point for fresh ideas for engineers involved in developing/adjusting diesel engines for usage of alternative fuels, researchers in renewable energy, as well as to engineers, advanced undergraduates, and postgraduates.

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the control design of nonlinear systems using feedback linearisation. The paper highlights the destabilisation effect of unmodelled actuator dynamics when applying feedback linearisation. To overcome this difficulty, a two stage feedback linearisation technique is proposed to compensate for actuator dynamics and subse- quently linearise nonlinear systems. A case study of a tri-rotor UAV is used to showcase the benefits of the proposed method in comparison with classical feedback linearisation. The paper is written from a UAV application's point of view, however, the proposed procedure is still valid for any input-affine invertible nonlinear system.},

We show that the degree distribution of the tree vertices follows a power law in an asymptotic sense. A simulation result is presented to support the theoretical claim. Based on these results we also try to establish a simple necessary condition for sampling based motion planners to be asymptotically optimal.},

The retrofit of houses should be followed by the amelioration of their surroundings. The priority order of districts to be renovated depends on the condition of the buildings in a district and on strategic urban development programmes. In order to determine the profitability of investments in housing retrofit, a number of retrofit scenarios should be developed. The authors of this paper offer a new approach to determining the retrofit effectiveness of houses based both on expected energy savings and the increase in market value of renovated buildings. In line with the proposed approach, retrofit scenarios for apartment buildings in Vilnius were developed, i.e. retrofit investment packages for various districts were prepared and arranged in the priority order for their application according to the method of geographical analysis suggested by the authors.},

abstract = {Acquiring and processing video streams from static cameras has been proposed as one of the most efficient tools for visualizing and gathering traffic information. With the latest advances in technology and visual media, combined with the increased needs in dealing with congestion more effectively and directly, the use of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) has emerged in the field of traffic engineering. In this paper, we review studies and applications that incorporate UAS in transportation research and practice with the aim to set the grounds from the proper understanding and implementation of UAS related surveillance systems in transportation and traffic engineering. The studies reviewed are categorized in different transportation engineering areas. Additional significant applications from other research fields are also referenced to identify other promising applications. Finally, issues and emerging challenges in both a conceptual and methodological level are revealed and discussed.},

Demonstrated in numerous military applications, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have great potentials as a part of ITS infrastructure for providing quick and real-time aerial video images of large surface area to the ground. Despite of obvious advantages of UAVs for traffic monitoring and many other civil applications, it is rare to encounter success stories of UAVs in civil application including transportation. The objective of this paper is to report the outcomes of research supported by the state agency to investigate the feasibility of integrating UAVs into urban highway traffic monitoring as a part of ITS infrastructure. These include current technical and regulatory issues, and possible suggestions for a future UAV system in civil applications.},

abstract = {The evaluation of building energy consumption usually requires building energy profiles on an hourly basis. Computer simulations can be used to obtain this information but generating simulations requires a significant amount of experience, time, and effort to enter detailed building parameters. This paper presents a simple methodology to estimate hourly electrical and fuel energy consumption of a building by applying a series of predetermined coefficients to the monthly energy consumption data from electrical and fuel utility bills. The advantage of having predetermined coefficients is that it relieves the user from the burden of performing a detailed dynamic simulation of the building. The coefficients provided to the user are obtained by running EnergyPlus Benchmark Models simulations; thus, the simulation process is transparent to the user. The methodology has been applied to a hypothetical building placed both in Atlanta, GA, and in Meridian, MS, and in both cases, errors obtained for the estimated hourly energy consumption are mainly within 10{\%}.},

abstract = {This paper address the phenomenon of drones and their potential relationship with the city from the point of view of the so-called “mobilities turn”. This is done in such a way that turns attention to a recent re-development of the “turn” towards design; so the emerging perspective of “mobilities design” will be used as a background perspective to reflect upon the future of drones in cities. The other perspective used to frame the phenomenon is the emerging discourse of the “smart city”. A city of proliferating digital information and data communication may be termed a smart city as shorthand for a new urban condition where cities are networked and connected (as well as disconnected) from the local block to global digital spheres. In the midst of many of the well-known data-creating devices (e.g. Bluetooth, radio-frequency identification (RFID), GPS, smartphone applications) there is a “new kid on the block” that will potentially be a game-changer for urban governance, economics and everyday life. Here we are thinking of the unmanned aerial vehicle or drone as the popular term has it. Therefore, the paper asks how life in “drone city” may play out. Drones may alter the notion of surveillance by means of being mobile, as well as profoundly altering the process and perspective of data collection and feedback to governments, businesses and citizens.},

abstract = {Over the last few decades, ecodesign has emerged as a promising approach to integrate environmental concerns into the product development and related processes. Ecodesign aims to minimize environmental impacts throughout the product's life cycle, without compromising other essential criteria such as performance and cost. Despite the potential benefits of ecodesign and the existence of several tools and techniques for product design, the actual application of ecodesign has not reached companies worldwide, mainly due to difficulties in ecodesign implementation and management. This paper introduces the ecodesign maturity model, a framework aimed at supporting the ecodesign implementation process. Based on a diagnosis of the current maturity profile of a company's product development and related processes regarding ecodesign implementation, the model proposes the most suitable ecodesign practices and improvement projects to be applied, by adopting a continuous improvement approach for process improvement. The model is thus intended to support ecodesign managers in their deployment of strategic and tactical roadmaps for ecodesign implementation. The paper discusses the main concept of the model and the results of its application into a large manufacturing company. In addition to the academic benefits related to the systematization of the ecodesign knowledge, the application of the model is shown to provide companies with: a benchmarking of ecodesign practices; an assessment of strengths and weaknesses; and a common language and a shared vision for ecodesign implementation.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating-actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Academics, politicians, professionals and the general public are aware that without stewarding our planet's natural resources, man is on the pathway towards a global collapse. Over the next three decades mankind is expected to consume an estimated 140 billion tons of minerals, ores, fossil fuels and biomass per year – three times current consumption. Social welfare and human wellbeing are threatened with the scarcity of natural resources; consequently, nations and their societies are also at risk of collapse. The readers of this special volume will find a compilation of scholarly research papers with real-life applications that take the challenge of proposing decision-making models and tools to address sustainability challenges in integrative ways. The main focus of this special volume is integration of sustainability dimensions (economic, social, environmental, ethical and time) into decision-support models and to identify pathways to achieve more sustainable societies. The majority of the research in this special volume, 74 percent, focuses on environmental and economic dimensions. Only 26 percent integrated social dimensions with them. Methodologically, a range of mathematical models and tools are presented to support prescriptive decision-making, with some descriptive models integrated, to support decision-makers in solving practical problems across a variety of industries and scenarios. The breadth and complexity of issues facing organizations and society requires innovative applications of these methodologies. The concerns cover a spectrum ranging from energy to solid waste management. A multitude of levels from broad-based policy concerns to strategic inter-organizational sustainable supply chain management and significantly, shop floor operational issues are also covered. The variety of problems and solutions exemplifies the potential for modelling and operations research for addressing some of our world's most pressing concerns.},

@article{Mahmoud2015,
abstract = {UAVs, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, have gained significant attention recently, due to the increasingly growing range of applications. Most UAVs use radio frequency transmission to communicate with the ground station to receive commands and send data. However, this model of communication restricts the user to being in specific locations and limits missions to narrow areas. This paper proposes a Cloud Computing (CC) integration where the UAVs become part of the cloud infrastructure and can be accessed ubiquitously. This concept is similar to the Internet of Things (IoT) where smart objects are connected to the Internet and are given unique identification. Moreover, to provide an appropriate way of communication, UAV resources are developed as web services. They provide their resources and services through a uniform interface using the RESTful HTTP architecture. This concept is relevant to the Web of Things (WoT) that provides smart objects with interfaces to be accessed through the World Wide Web (WWW). However, in UAVs, not only the web services are computational services but they are also physical elements affecting and affected by the real world environment.},

abstract = {Educational sector is growing drastically as a result of upward trend of population. These schools require tremendous quantities of energy units to be generated and consumed. As a result, this will impact negatively on the environment by increasing the carbon emissions and depletion of non-renewable energy resources. Moreover, the harsh climate condition contributes substantially to increase the energy consumption in various weather zones in the world. Therefore, several energy efficiency plans have been developed to improve the energy performance of the schools facilities globally. Hence, this paper discusses the energy management program as a sustainable strategy that applicable on the schools. This program is designed for the schools to improve the energy efficiency, indoor environmental quality and adopting the best management practices during the operating stages. This research has developed a customized energy management program for one of the schools in UAE. It has concluded the findings by using computerized hourly thermal modeling. The energy model has evaluated the proposed energy conservation measures and the best practices that were generated by the energy management program steps. This case shows that the energy performance could be improved substantially by 35{\%}. Thus, the energy use index of the audited school that adopted the energy management program has reduced from 438 kWh/m2/year to 285 kWh/m2/year. The proposed energy management program has been articulated in this study as a consecutive and linear progression. This methodology presents several steps to mitigate the carbon emission by addressing the sustainability dimensions; economic, environment and social aspects. This study discusses the steps and the work flow of developing the energy management program and the anticipated outcomes for the school's buildings. The program considers practical ECMs along with the students and teachers participation and interaction. Furthermore, it highlights the success criteria that assure the sustainability of the energy efficiency at the operating life cycle of school's facilities.},

@article{Sharma2017,
abstract = {On-line motion planning in unknown environments is a challenging problem as it requires (i) ensuring collision avoidance and (ii) minimizing the motion time, while continuously predicting where to go next. Previous approaches to on-line motion planning assume that a rough map of the environment is available, thereby simplifying the problem. This paper presents a reactive on-line motion planner, Robust Autonomous Waypoint generation (RAW), for mobile robots navigating in unknown and unstructured environments. RAW generates a locally maximal ellipsoid around the robot, using semi-definite programming, such that the surrounding obstacles lie outside the ellipsoid. A reinforcement learning agent then generates a local waypoint in the robot's field of view, inside the ellipsoid. The robot navigates to the waypoint and the process iterates until it reaches the goal. By following the waypoints the robot navigates through a sequence of overlapping ellipsoids, and avoids collision. Robot's safety is guaranteed theoretically and the claims are validated through rigorous numerical experiments in four different experimental setups. Near-optimality is shown empirically by comparing RAW trajectories with the global optimal trajectories.},

@article{Atias2017,
abstract = {We study the effectiveness of metrics for Multi-Robot Motion-Planning (MRMP) when using RRT-style sampling-based planners. These metrics play the crucial role of determining the nearest neighbors of configurations and in that they regulate the connectivity of the underlying roadmaps produced by the planners and other properties like the quality of solution paths. After screening over a dozen different metrics we focus on the five most promising ones- two more traditional metrics, and three novel ones which we propose here, adapted from the domain of shape-matching. In addition to the novel multi-robot metrics, a central contribution of this work are tools to analyze and predict the effectiveness of metrics in the MRMP context. We identify a suite of possible substructures in the configuration space, for which it is fairly easy (i) to define a so-called natural distance which allows us to predict the performance of a metric. This is done by comparing the distribution of its values for sampled pairs of configurations to the distribution induced by the natural distance; (ii) to define equivalence classes of configurations and test how well a metric covers the different classes. We provide experiments that attest to the ability of our tools to predict the effectiveness of metrics: those metrics that qualify in the analysis yield higher success rate of the planner with fewer vertices in the roadmap. We also show how combining several metrics together leads to better results (success rate and size of roadmap) than using a single metric.},

abstract = {-In the last years, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) have been developed for a variety of civil applications, such as agriculture, aerial photogrammetry and topographic mapping, environmental monitoring, search and rescue, prevent of fires and disasters, environmental research, monitoring of artistic heritage and general photography and videos. Multi-rotor and fixed-wing configurations are the most common platforms, but for the next years lighter-than-air vehicles (i.e. blimps) could represent an important niche market. In order to establish a set of rules to ensure the safety of RPAS operations, many countries have developed regulation for RPAS with a Maximum Take-Off Mass (MTOM) of less than 150 kg. In 2015, ENAC, the Italian aviation authority, has published the second edition of the regulatory issues for this kind of aircraft. This edition looks ahead to the forthcoming common EU regulation and further amendments will be considered based on (EASA, 2015) and further EASA reports. The reference rules introduce a distinction between RPAS with a MTOM equal to or larger than 25 kg and RPAS with MTOM of less than 25 kg. The operator must provide to ENAC a series of documents that demonstrate that the system is compliant with the regulatory restrictions, in particular the results of risk assessment in order to motivate the safety of the in-flight operations. The aim of this paper is the presentation of a novel methodology for risk assessment applied to different RPAS with a MTOM lower than 25 kg, also including lighter-than-air configurations. This methodology concerns with ground impacts and does not cover the aspects of mid-air collisions. The results of this analysis provide a comprehensive insight for mission feasibility and operational implications in a set of realistic application cases. Practical solutions are proposed for risk mitigation of RPAS operations enforcing a concept of general validity, also compliant with forthcoming common EU regulations, applicable at continental level.},

However, there are many cities whose visual image is lacking the presence of correct and sustainable streetscape, which negatively affects the visual image of these cities, and consequently the place of those cities globally. In this context, the research aims to activate the role of sustainable streetscape as an approach to provide an attractive and safe sustainable urban environment, and to sustain the development process for the visual image of cities, especially in Egypt, through focusing on the elements and basic principles of sustainable streetscape that should be taken into account to define sustainable streetscape. So that, the analytical study covers some international examples in applying the basic principles of sustainable streetscape in order to use it to develop streetscape of one of the main urban streets in Egypt. The research concludes the importance of developing urban environment visual image in Egypt, through directing urban planners and designers to the important role of streetscape in achieving sustainable development, in addition to identify the methods of application of sustainability in streetscape.},

@article{Ribu2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND The present study protocol is designed to cover the Norwegian part of the European Union Collaborative Project-REgioNs of Europe WorkINg together for HEALTH (RENEWING HEALTH). Self-management support is an important element of care for persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D) for achieving metabolic control and positive lifestyle changes. Telemedicine (TM) with or without health counseling may become an important technological aid for self-management and may provide a user-centered model of care. In spite of many earlier studies on TM, there remains a lack of consensus in research findings about the effect of TM interventions. OBJECTIVE The aim of RENEWING HEALTH is to validate and evaluate innovative TM tools on a large scale through a common evaluation, making it easier for decision makers to choose the most efficient and cost-effective technological interventions. The Norwegian pilot study evaluates whether the introduction of a mobile phone with a diabetes diary application together with health counseling intervention produces benefits in terms of the desired outcomes, as reflected in the hemoglobin A1c level, health-related quality of life, behavior change, and cost-effectiveness. METHODS The present study has a mixed-method design comprising a three-armed prospective randomized controlled trial and qualitative interviews with study data collected at three time points: baseline, after 4 months, and after 1 year. The patients' registrations on the application are recorded continuously and are sent securely to a server. RESULTS The inclusion of patients started in March 2011, and 100{\%} of the planned sample size is included (N=151). Of all the participants, 26/151 patients (17.2{\%}) are lost to follow-up by now, and 11/151 patients (7.3{\%}) are still in the trial. Results of the study protocol will be presented in 2014. CONCLUSIONS The key goals of this trial are to investigate the effect of an electronic diabetes diary app with and without health counseling, and to determine whether health counseling is important to the continued use of the application and the patients' health competence and acceptability. Research within this area is needed because few studies have investigated the effectiveness of apps used in long-term interventions with this degree of self-management.

abstract = {Current practices and major trends in unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) for maritime operations are presented along with projections of future UAS maritime applications. First, various aspects of UAS program management, including organization, operator responsibilities, program operation, and overall program costs, are reviewed. Next, maritime aircraft missions and required capabilities are outlined, and current practices for both manned and unmanned aircraft are described. Technological trends relating to UAS are also discussed, focusing on developments relevant to maritime UAS operations. This information provides a background for assessing potential future maritime UAS operations. Trends including miniaturization of sensors and computer systems, high energy density of power sources, and increased subsystem standardization and modularity will have important effects in the future. However, another significant trend is towards increased system autonomy via new command and control frameworks that facilitate integration of UAS into higher level maritime observing systems through new concepts of operation for networked systems and new business models.},

abstract = {Since the end of the 1990s, sustainability reporting has become an increasingly relevant topic in business and academia. However, literature is still limited in quantity and no major reviews of the latest developments have thus far been presented. This paper provides a review of 178 articles dating from 1999 to 2011 from journals related to business, management, and accounting. Our aim is to identify what determinants of sustainability reporting are examined in the literature and to identify (in)consistencies, gaps, and opportunities for future research. We specifically illuminate factors influencing the adoption, the extent, and the quality of reporting. Based on our findings we provide an otherwise often missing link to theory (especially legitimacy, stakeholder, signaling, and institutional theory). Finally, possible future research themes are discussed by illuminating gaps and underexposed themes in the area of regulation and governance as well as reporting quality and stakeholder perception.},

abstract = {In this study the conjugate thermodynamic and dynamic modeling of a single cylinder four-stroke diesel engine was conducted. The gas pressure in cylinder was calculated with the first law of the thermodynamic and the general state equation of the perfect gases. The variation of the heat, given to the working fluid during the heating process of the thermodynamic cycle, was modeled with the Gaussian function. The dynamic model of the engine consists of the motion equations of piston, conrod and crankshaft. Conrod motion was modeled by 2 translational and 1 angular motion equations. In the derivation of the motion equations, the Newton method was used. Motion equations involve hydrodynamic and asperity frictions as well as gas forces. By preparing a heat release rate profile consistent with ones given in the literature, thermal efficiency, knocking, vibration, torque and emission characteristics of the engine were investigated. The counterweight mass and its radial distance were optimized. At full load, if the heat release period is initiated soon after the piston passed the top dead center, the pressure rise rate becomes critical from the knocking point of view however, a couple of degree of retarding of the heat release period avoids the knocking without causing significant loss in thermal efficiency. If the throttling is more than 70{\%}, the temperature of the combustion gas is high enough for NOx formation. At full load the vibrational torque exerting on the crankshaft was determined as about 17 times the engine torque.},

@article{Yehoshua2015a,
abstract = {The general problem of covering an area is a fundamental problem in robotics with applications in various domains. In a recently introduced version of the problem, adversarial coverage, the covering robot operates in an environment that contains threats that might stop it. Previous studies of this problem dealt with finding optimal strategies for the coverage, that minimize both the coverage time and the probability that the robot will be stopped before completing the coverage. However, these studies assumed a simplistic adversarial model, in which the threats are randomly scattered across the environment. In this paper, we allow the adversary to choose the locations of the threats in a way that maximizes the probability of stopping the robot performing the coverage. In other words, we discuss the problem of finding the best strategy to defend a given area from being covered by an agent, using k given guards. We show that although in general finding an optimal strategy for an adversary with zero knowledge is AfV-Haid, for certain values of A; an optimal strategy can be found in polynomial time, and for others we suggest heuristics that can significantly improve the random baseline strategy.},

@article{AlFaris2016,
abstract = {Educational sector is growing drastically as a result of upward trend of population. These schools require tremendous quantities of energy units to be generated and consumed. As a result, this will impact negatively on the environment by increasing the carbon emissions and depletion of non-renewable energy resources. Moreover, the harsh climate condition contributes substantially to increase the energy consumption in various weather zones in the world. Therefore, several energy efficiency plans have been developed to improve the energy performance of the schools facilities globally. Hence, this paper discusses the energy management program as a sustainable strategy that applicable on the schools. This program is designed for the schools to improve the energy efficiency, indoor environmental quality and adopting the best management practices during the operating stages. This research has developed a customized energy management program for one of the schools in UAE. It has concluded the findings by using computerized hourly thermal modeling. The energy model has evaluated the proposed energy conservation measures and the best practices that were generated by the energy management program steps. This case shows that the energy performance could be improved substantially by 35{\%}. Thus, the energy use index of the audited school that adopted the energy management program has reduced from 438 kWh/m2/year to 285 kWh/m2/year. The proposed energy management program has been articulated in this study as a consecutive and linear progression. This methodology presents several steps to mitigate the carbon emission by addressing the sustainability dimensions; economic, environment and social aspects. This study discusses the steps and the work flow of developing the energy management program and the anticipated outcomes for the school's buildings. The program considers practical ECMs along with the students and teachers participation and interaction. Furthermore, it highlights the success criteria that assure the sustainability of the energy efficiency at the operating life cycle of school's facilities.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the problem of asynchronous repetitive control for a class of discrete-time Markovian switching systems. The control goal is to track a given periodic reference without steady-state error. To achieve this goal, an asynchronous repetitive controller that renders the overall closed-loop switched system mean square stable is proposed. To reflect realistic scenarios, the proposed approach does not assume that the system modes are available synchronously to the controller but instead designs a detector that provides estimated values of the system modes to the controller. Based on a detected-mode-dependent estimator, the plant and asynchronous repetitive controller are formulated as a closed-loop stochastic system. By utilizing tools from stochastic Lyapunov{\&}{\#}x2013;Krasovskii stability theory, we develop sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) such that the closed-loop system is mean square stable and also simultaneously establish a synthesis procedure for obtaining the gain matrices. We provide numerical simulations on an electrical circuit switched system to illustrate the approach.},

abstract = {We investigated different dense multirotor UAV traffic simulation scenarios in open 2D and 3D space, under realistic environments with the presence of sensor noise, communication delay, limited communication range, limited sensor update rate and finite inertia. We implemented two fundamental self-organized algorithms: one with constant direction and one with constant velocity preference to reach a desired target. We performed evolutionary optimization on both algorithms in five basic traffic scenarios and tested the optimized algorithms under different vehicle densities. We provide optimal algorithm and parameter selection criteria and compare the maximal flux and collision risk of each solution and situation. We found that i) different scenarios and densities require different algorithmic approaches, i.e., UAVs have to behave differently in sparse and dense environments or when they have common or different targets; ii) a slower-is-faster effect is implicitly present in our models, i.e., the maximal flux is achieved at densities where the average speed is far from maximal; iii) communication delay is the most severe destabilizing environmental condition that has a fundamental effect on performance and needs to be taken into account when designing algorithms to be used in real life.},

@article{Colicchia2013,
abstract = {Environmental sustainability has recently become more and more of a concern among both academics and practitioners. In particular logistics services operations can play a significant role in reducing the environmental burden of the supply chain. Although studies on these issues have been progressively increasing in the extant literature, still little investigation has been performed among Logistics Service Providers (LSPs). The present paper aims to fill this gap and provides the results of an empirical study on the adoption of environmental initiatives in the contract logistics industry, along with the metrics used for environmental performance measurement and the barriers and drivers that may hinder or facilitate the adoption of these initiatives. After a careful literature review, a framework was developed to identify the initiatives towards environmental sustainability with a focus on companies involved in logistics and transportation processes. The framework was applied to a set of ten LSPs by examining their environmental reporting and a sub-set of three companies was finally selected for in-depth interviews. An analysis of the environmental sustainability initiatives of primary multinational LSPs and their adoption level is presented. The present paper contributes to the knowledge of environmental sustainability for logistics and transportation and offers new insights in theory, paving the way for further research on these topics.},

abstract = {In this study the conjugate thermodynamic and dynamic modeling of a single cylinder four-stroke diesel engine was conducted. The gas pressure in cylinder was calculated with the first law of the thermodynamic and the general state equation of the perfect gases. The variation of the heat, given to the working fluid during the heating process of the thermodynamic cycle, was modeled with the Gaussian function. The dynamic model of the engine consists of the motion equations of piston, conrod and crankshaft. Conrod motion was modeled by 2 translational and 1 angular motion equations. In the derivation of the motion equations, the Newton method was used. Motion equations involve hydrodynamic and asperity frictions as well as gas forces. By preparing a heat release rate profile consistent with ones given in the literature, thermal efficiency, knocking, vibration, torque and emission characteristics of the engine were investigated. The counterweight mass and its radial distance were optimized. At full load, if the heat release period is initiated soon after the piston passed the top dead center, the pressure rise rate becomes critical from the knocking point of view however, a couple of degree of retarding of the heat release period avoids the knocking without causing significant loss in thermal efficiency. If the throttling is more than 70{\%}, the temperature of the combustion gas is high enough for NOx formation. At full load the vibrational torque exerting on the crankshaft was determined as about 17 times the engine torque.},

abstract = {-In the last years, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) have been developed for a variety of civil applications, such as agriculture, aerial photogrammetry and topographic mapping, environmental monitoring, search and rescue, prevent of fires and disasters, environmental research, monitoring of artistic heritage and general photography and videos. Multi-rotor and fixed-wing configurations are the most common platforms, but for the next years lighter-than-air vehicles (i.e. blimps) could represent an important niche market. In order to establish a set of rules to ensure the safety of RPAS operations, many countries have developed regulation for RPAS with a Maximum Take-Off Mass (MTOM) of less than 150 kg. In 2015, ENAC, the Italian aviation authority, has published the second edition of the regulatory issues for this kind of aircraft. This edition looks ahead to the forthcoming common EU regulation and further amendments will be considered based on (EASA, 2015) and further EASA reports. The reference rules introduce a distinction between RPAS with a MTOM equal to or larger than 25 kg and RPAS with MTOM of less than 25 kg. The operator must provide to ENAC a series of documents that demonstrate that the system is compliant with the regulatory restrictions, in particular the results of risk assessment in order to motivate the safety of the in-flight operations. The aim of this paper is the presentation of a novel methodology for risk assessment applied to different RPAS with a MTOM lower than 25 kg, also including lighter-than-air configurations. This methodology concerns with ground impacts and does not cover the aspects of mid-air collisions. The results of this analysis provide a comprehensive insight for mission feasibility and operational implications in a set of realistic application cases. Practical solutions are proposed for risk mitigation of RPAS operations enforcing a concept of general validity, also compliant with forthcoming common EU regulations, applicable at continental level.},

abstract = {Previous research suggests that, despite a desire to introduce environmental concerns into New Product Design, many companies in the northwest of England have not done so. In order to understand more about why companies do or do not take on sustainability methodologies, an entirely new and rigorous approach was taken. This paper therefore presents the results of a questionnaire investigating the up-take of Eco/Sustainable Design in manufacturing companies in Sweden – a country that might be considered more environmentally progressive than the UK – and discusses them alongside the results of an identical questionnaire in the UK. The results are presented in the context of risk and risk aversion/management – in particular the risk associated with taking on board Design for Sustainability as a design method or a company strategy. It is found that there is no clear “winner” in sustainability between UK and Swedish engineering companies; there is encouraging news in both countries, with a desire to practice sustainability, but some that is not so good with the number of companies that actually implement relevant methodologies. It is apparent that there are still hindrances and perceived risks preventing companies taking sustainability fully on board, despite the recognition that sustainability is a “good thing”; the importance of the implementation of sustainability has not yet been fully grasped by industry and by those with the responsibility required to effect any changes.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present a powerful simulation-based multi-objective optimization of building energy efficiency and indoor thermal comfort to obtain the optimal solutions of the comfort-energy efficient configurations of building envelope. The optimization method is developed by integrating a multi-objective artificial bee colony (MOABC) optimization algorithm implemented in MATLAB with EnergyPlus building energy simulation tool. The proposed optimization approach is applied to a single office room; and the building parameters, including the room rotation, window size, cooling and heating setpoint temperatures, glazing and wall material properties are considered as decision variables. In the present study, single-objective and multi-objective optimization analyses of the total annual building electricity consumption and the Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied (PPD) are investigated to bring down the total energy cost as well as the thermal discomfort in four major climate regions of Iran, i.e. temperate, warm-dry, warm-humid and cold ones. In the results part, the achieved optimal solutions are presented in the form of Pareto fronts to reveal the mutual impacts of variables on the building energy consumption and the thermal discomfort. Finally, the ultimate optimum solution on the Pareto fronts are selected by TOPSIS decision-making method and the results of double-objective minimization problem are compared with the single-objective ones as well as the base design. The results of double-objective optimization problem indicate that in different climates, even though the total building electricity consumption increases a bit about 2.9–11.3{\%}, the PPD significantly decreases about 49.1–56.8{\%} compared to the baseline model. In addition, the comparisons of single-objective and double-objective optimization approaches clearly show that multi-objective optimization methods yield more appropriate results respect to the single ones, mainly because of the lower deviation index value from the ideal solution.},

abstract = {With increasing pollution of ecological environment and global warming, more and more countries and governments have enacted double environmental medium (DEM) regulations (i.e., regulations focused on greenhouse gas emission and regulations focused on waste disposal) to curb environmental impact. Based on the triple bottom line principles and DEM regulations, this paper clarifies environmental bottom line into ecological impact and carbon emission bottom lines, the former one of which is contingent on ecological footprint, while the latter one depends on carbon footprint. According to supply chain structure and product life cycle, we analyze environmental impact (i.e., ecological and carbon impact) reduction strategies simultaneously in production, distribution, use and disposal phases as well. Our conclusions show that for production phase, ecological footprint reduction need to remove toxic substances, and carbon footprint could be reduced by improving demand forecast accuracy and investment in carbon reduction technology; For distribution phase, carbon footprint could be mitigated by using smaller packaging and joint distribution, allying with third party logistics providers and adopting cross-docking network; For use phase, carbon footprint could be abated by improving energy efficiency and shortening using time, in some cases, however, shortening using time can increase ecological footprint. For disposal phase, combination of between design for ecology and comprehensive take-back (return) networks could decrease ecological impacts efficiently.},

abstract = {In this article, the three-phase asynchronous motor is taken as the research object, and the deadbeat predictive control is the control core, and its control performance is studied. Considering the overshoot of flux linkage and speed response in deadbeat predictive control, an improved deadbeat predictive control algorithm based on synergy theory is proposed. Different from deadbeat predictive control, improved deadbeat predictive control can control the flux linkage and speed independently through two adjustment parameters, which are achieved through the manifold of synergy theory. To accurately obtain the feedback flux linkage and load torque in the control, a flux observer and a load torque observer are designed. Based on these, a simulation platform is built, and the control performance of the two control algorithms is compared. The robustness of the two control algorithms is further verified by changing parameters. Finally, the experimental platform of three-phase asynchronous motor is built in this article. The experimental program based on deadbeat predictive control is designed. The no-load experiment and loading experiment are carried out, respectively. The feasibility of the algorithm is verified by experimental data.},

@article{Lotufo2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 This study investigates the use of the feedback linearization approach as a novel way to design the internal model for Embedded Model Control (EMC). The feedback linearization allows to collect all the nonlinearities at command level. EMC, by means of a disturbance dynamics model, makes possible to estimate and then reject the non-linear terms through the control law. This idea is applied to the control of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle: the Borea project quadrotor. Embedded Model Control methodology implies the design of an internal model (Embedded Model) coded into the control unit and running in parallel with the plant. The attitude reconstruction problem is faced by means of a state observer developed on purpose and fully integrated with the model. A two-modes control strategy is proposed in order to reject systematic sensor errors, thus enhancing the attitude estimation capability. Using a high-fidelity numerical simulator, the feasibility of the proposed control strategy was demonstrated. This indicates that a feedback linearization approach allows the extension of EMC techniques to non-linear systems control. What is more, the EMC was successfully applied to the control of the Borea quadrotor.},

@article{Papadopoulos2016,
abstract = {Building Performance Simulation (BPS) is an established method used in the design phase of buildings to predict energy consumption and guide design choices. Despite their advanced abilities to model complex building systems, BPS tools typically fail to account for different and changing energy use characteristics of building occupants, contributing to important prediction errors. In parallel, Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged in recent years as a technique capable of capturing occupants' dynamic energy consumption behaviors and actions. However, ABM lacks the building simulation capabilities to account for the complexity of various building systems in energy calculations. This research proposes a new modeling framework that integrates BPS in ABM using trained regression surrogate models. The framework is unique in its ability to (1) simulate energy use attributes of building occupants and facility managers, (2) translate those attributes to robust energy consumption estimates, and (3) help quantify the impact of uncertainty in human actions on the performance of the built environment. The framework is tested and illustrated in a case study on a prototype office building. Results indicate that providing occupants with control over their building systems can mitigate the effect of uncertainty in human actions on the performance of the built environment.},

@article{Bordalba2017,
abstract = {This paper presents a motion planner for systems subject to kinematic and dynamic constraints. The former appear when kinematic loops are present in the system, such as in parallel manipulators, in robots that cooperate to achieve a given task, or in situations involving contacts with the environment. The latter are necessary to obtain realistic trajectories, taking into account the forces acting on the system. The kinematic constraints make the state space become an implicitly-defined manifold, which complicates the application of common motion planning techniques. To address this issue, the planner constructs an atlas of the state space manifold incrementally, and uses this atlas both to generate random states and to dynamically simulate the steering of the system towards such states. The resulting tools are then exploited to construct a rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) over the state space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized kinodynamic planner for implicitly-defined state spaces. The test cases presented in this paper validate the approach in significantly-complex systems.},

abstract = {A broad range of simulation software applications has become available for a variety of building performance assessments over the last three decades. The maturation of building simulation into a recognized and indispensable discipline for all professions, involved in the design, engineering, operation and management of buildings has now become the imminent challenge. The two key aspects dominate this evolution process: (1) attaining an increased level of quality assurance and (2) offering efficient integration of simulation expertise and tools in the overall building process. With its original base functionality in the design phase, simulation is now becoming increasingly relevant in other stages of a project, such as during commissioning, as well as in the operational facility management phase. Meanwhile, the ‘appearance' of simulation is changing constantly, not in the least as a result of the Internet revolution. This is exemplified by new forms of ubiquitous, remote, collaborative and pervasive simulation. These and other trends and manifestations are discussed in the light of the challenges that the building simulation discipline faces in becoming a daily instrument in the design and operation of buildings.},

@article{Alvear2017,
abstract = {Air pollution monitoring has recently become an issue of utmost importance in our society. Despite the fact that crowdsensing approaches could be an adequate solution for urban areas, they cannot be implemented in rural environments. Instead, deploying a fleet of UAVs could be considered an acceptable alternative. Embracing this approach, this paper proposes the use of UAVs equipped with off-the-shelf sensors to perform air pollution monitoring tasks. These UAVs are guided by our proposed Pollution-driven UAV Control (PdUC) algorithm, which is based on a chemotaxis metaheuristic and a local particle swarm optimization strategy. Together, they allow automatically performing the monitoring of a specified area using UAVs. Experimental results show that, when using PdUC, an implicit priority guides the construction of pollution maps by focusing on areas where the pollutants' concentration is higher. This way, accurate maps can be constructed in a faster manner when compared to other strategies. The PdUC scheme is compared against various standard mobility models through simulation, showing that it achieves better performance. In particular, it is able to find the most polluted areas with more accuracy and provides a higher coverage within the time bounds defined by the UAV flight time.},

@article{karaman2010incremental,
abstract = {During the last decade, incremental sampling-based motion planning algorithms, such as the Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRTs) have been shown to work well in practice and to possess theoretical guarantees such as probabilistic completeness. However, no theoretical bounds on the quality of the solution obtained by these algorithms have been established so far. The first contribution of this paper is a negative result: it is proven that, under mild technical conditions, the cost of the best path in the RRT converges almost surely to a non-optimal value. Second, a new algorithm is considered, called the Rapidly-exploring Random Graph (RRG), and it is shown that the cost of the best path in the RRG converges to the optimum almost surely. Third, a tree version of RRG is introduced, called the RRT{\$}{\^{}}*{\$} algorithm, which preserves the asymptotic optimality of RRG while maintaining a tree structure like RRT. The analysis of the new algorithms hinges on novel connections between sampling-based motion planning algorithms and the theory of random geometric graphs. In terms of computational complexity, it is shown that the number of simple operations required by both the RRG and RRT{\$}{\^{}}*{\$} algorithms is asymptotically within a constant factor of that required by RRT.},

At this point, a critical question is raised; to what extent the architectural identity of the city could be influenced by the adoption of the different sustainability trends? This question represents the main research question that the paper will address. The adopted sustainability trends vary in their forms and contents. Some trends employed sustainability principles inspired from the vernacular architecture, which not only give a tested and reliable model, but also enhances socio-cultural and economic values of the local community. Another trends employed sustainability principles that are based on the most modern and advanced technology which expresses the culture of globalization. While a third trend integrates both of the two trends to introduce a contemporary interpretation of the vernacular thought within the framework of modern advancements trying to bridge the gap between the local and the global. From this point of view, this paper focuses on two key issues; firstly: study and analysis of the mentioned sustainability trends in housing design, secondly: assessing and analyzing the impact of these trends on shaping the identity of the Arab city.},

abstract = {-In the last years, Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) have been developed for a variety of civil applications, such as agriculture, aerial photogrammetry and topographic mapping, environmental monitoring, search and rescue, prevent of fires and disasters, environmental research, monitoring of artistic heritage and general photography and videos. Multi-rotor and fixed-wing configurations are the most common platforms, but for the next years lighter-than-air vehicles (i.e. blimps) could represent an important niche market. In order to establish a set of rules to ensure the safety of RPAS operations, many countries have developed regulation for RPAS with a Maximum Take-Off Mass (MTOM) of less than 150 kg. In 2015, ENAC, the Italian aviation authority, has published the second edition of the regulatory issues for this kind of aircraft. This edition looks ahead to the forthcoming common EU regulation and further amendments will be considered based on (EASA, 2015) and further EASA reports. The reference rules introduce a distinction between RPAS with a MTOM equal to or larger than 25 kg and RPAS with MTOM of less than 25 kg. The operator must provide to ENAC a series of documents that demonstrate that the system is compliant with the regulatory restrictions, in particular the results of risk assessment in order to motivate the safety of the in-flight operations. The aim of this paper is the presentation of a novel methodology for risk assessment applied to different RPAS with a MTOM lower than 25 kg, also including lighter-than-air configurations. This methodology concerns with ground impacts and does not cover the aspects of mid-air collisions. The results of this analysis provide a comprehensive insight for mission feasibility and operational implications in a set of realistic application cases. Practical solutions are proposed for risk mitigation of RPAS operations enforcing a concept of general validity, also compliant with forthcoming common EU regulations, applicable at continental level.},

abstract = {Improving building energy efficiency and decreasing building energy consumption through monitoring of heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) and heat recovery systems are becoming increasingly significant due to global energy crisis and carbon emission. Therefore, evaluation on building energy efficiency and energy conservation is extremely necessary. In the present work, energy conservation performance of one low-energy school building will be intensively investigated based on more than three-year measurement results from the monitoring system with sensor network. Heat recovery efficiency and new energy conservation parameter were analytically modeled, taking the building mechanical ventilation network into account. Following that, building energy performance has been experimentally investigated concerning the effects of mechanical ventilation rates, outdoor temperature and the efficiency of the heat recovery facility. Subsequent energy performance analysis demonstrates that building energy demands for ventilation and winter heating could be decreased with the enhancement of heat recovery efficiency of the ventilation facility, and the energy conservation ratio of the air conditioning unit increases with the temperature of supply fresh air. Diverse situations of energy conservation ratio and heat recovery efficiency have been detailedly correlated according to measurement results.},

@article{Papadopoulos2016,
abstract = {Building Performance Simulation (BPS) is an established method used in the design phase of buildings to predict energy consumption and guide design choices. Despite their advanced abilities to model complex building systems, BPS tools typically fail to account for different and changing energy use characteristics of building occupants, contributing to important prediction errors. In parallel, Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged in recent years as a technique capable of capturing occupants' dynamic energy consumption behaviors and actions. However, ABM lacks the building simulation capabilities to account for the complexity of various building systems in energy calculations. This research proposes a new modeling framework that integrates BPS in ABM using trained regression surrogate models. The framework is unique in its ability to (1) simulate energy use attributes of building occupants and facility managers, (2) translate those attributes to robust energy consumption estimates, and (3) help quantify the impact of uncertainty in human actions on the performance of the built environment. The framework is tested and illustrated in a case study on a prototype office building. Results indicate that providing occupants with control over their building systems can mitigate the effect of uncertainty in human actions on the performance of the built environment.},

The second type involves a new approach to an adaptive sliding mode controller using input augmentation in order to account for the underactuated property of the helicopter, sensor noise, and uncertainty without using control inputs of large magnitude. The sliding mode controller performs very well under noisy conditions, and adaptation can effectively estimate uncertainty such as ground effects.},

@article{Ahmad2016,
abstract = {Buildings are responsible for 40{\%} of global energy use and contribute towards 30{\%} of the total CO2 emissions. The drive to reduce energy consumption and associated greenhouse gas emissions from buildings has acted as a catalyst in the increasing installation of meters and sensors for monitoring energy use and indoor environmental conditions in buildings. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in building energy metering and environmental monitoring, including their social, economic, environmental and legislative drivers. The integration of meters and sensors with existing building energy management systems (BEMS) is critically appraised, especially with regard to communication technologies and protocols such as ModBus, M-Bus, Ethernet, Cellular, ZigBee, WiFi and BACnet. Findings suggest that energy metering is covered in existing policies and regulations in only a handful of countries. Most of the legislations and policies on energy metering in Europe are in response to the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD), 2002/91/EC. However, recent developments in policy are pointing towards more stringent metering requirements in future, moving away from voluntary to mandatory compliance. With regards to metering equipment, significant developments have been made in the recent past on miniaturisation, accuracy, robustness, data storage, ability to connect using multiple communication protocols, and the integration with BEMS and the Cloud – resulting in a range of available solutions, selection of which can be challenging. Developments in communication technologies, in particular in low-power wireless such as ZigBee and Bluetooth LE (BLE), are enabling cost-effective machine to machine (M2M) and internet of things (IoT) implementation of sensor networks. Privacy and data protection, however, remain a concern for data aggregators and end-users. The standardization of network protocols and device functionalities remains an active area of research and development, especially due to the prevalence of many protocols in the BEMS industry. Available solutions often lack interoperability between hardware and software systems, resulting in vendor lock-in. The paper provides a comprehensive understanding of available technologies for energy metering and environmental monitoring; their drivers, advantages and limitations; factors affecting their selection and future directions of research and development – for use a reference, as well as for generating further interest in this expanding research area.},

The calibration method accounts for hard and soft iron effects created by the platform, sensor errors like biases, scale factors and non-orthogonalities as well as the relative orientation between the magnetometer and the accelerometer. The algorithm is based on a least squares problem, which is solved using a singular value decomposition. During the calibration process the spatial orientation of the platform is not needed. Therefore no additional hardware is required. The functionality and accuracy of the algorithm is shown using simulated sensor readings.},

@article{Papadopoulos2016,
abstract = {Building Performance Simulation (BPS) is an established method used in the design phase of buildings to predict energy consumption and guide design choices. Despite their advanced abilities to model complex building systems, BPS tools typically fail to account for different and changing energy use characteristics of building occupants, contributing to important prediction errors. In parallel, Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) has emerged in recent years as a technique capable of capturing occupants' dynamic energy consumption behaviors and actions. However, ABM lacks the building simulation capabilities to account for the complexity of various building systems in energy calculations. This research proposes a new modeling framework that integrates BPS in ABM using trained regression surrogate models. The framework is unique in its ability to (1) simulate energy use attributes of building occupants and facility managers, (2) translate those attributes to robust energy consumption estimates, and (3) help quantify the impact of uncertainty in human actions on the performance of the built environment. The framework is tested and illustrated in a case study on a prototype office building. Results indicate that providing occupants with control over their building systems can mitigate the effect of uncertainty in human actions on the performance of the built environment.},

This paper provides an overview of such advancements achieved between 1987 and 2014, during which Professor Branko Todorovich served as Editor in Chief of Energy and Buildings Journal. The review, however, was not restricted to this journal only, in order to provide a fair snapshot on overall technique advances. Simulation and computational techniques cover a variety of aspects of building. This paper focuses specifically on six different topics including ventilation performance prediction, whole building energy and thermal load simulation, lighting and daylighting modeling, building information modeling, indoor acoustic simulation, and life cycle analysis of buildings. Major advances in each area are highlighted, as well as the trends for development and application.},

As a consequence, city authorities are increasingly facing the challenge of finding ways to include adaptation strategies into their work, although related knowledge and competence is still scarce and fragmented. With the aim to contribute to knowledge development and organizational learning, the objective of this paper is to critically review and compare current theoretical and practical approaches to adaptation planning in cities. In order to do so, first the conceptual characteristics and features of a climate resilient city are identified. Second, the reciprocal linkages between climate-related disasters, urban form and city planning processes are analysed – by considering the life cycle of disasters from causes, to short- and long-term impacts, to post-disaster response and recovery. Finally, urban adaptation measures proposed for both developed and so-called developing countries are assessed. On the basis of the identified differences, gaps and synergies between the theoretical and practical approaches to adaptation planning, the implications for improving sustainable urban transformation are discussed.},

There is a significant potential of biomass residues in Sweden suitable for the extraction of various compounds, including upgrading by biocatalytic processes, in addition to current energy generation. Two examples presented are quercetin extracted from onion waste by pressurised hot water in conjunction with enzymatic hydrolysis, and betulin from birch bark extracted by liquid CO2 containing ethanol. Inherent in these two extraction processes and production routes is the ability to show good environmental performance from a life cycle perspective. Extraction of high-value compounds also provides possibilities for innovation in the current agricultural, food and forest industry potentially leading to socio-economical benefits.},

abstract = {Fault Diagnosis and Fault-Tolerant Control and Guidance for Aerospace demonstrates the attractive potential of recent developments in control for resolving such issues as flight performance, self protection and extended-life structures. Importantly, the text deals with a number of practically significant considerations: tuning, complexity of design, real-time capability, evaluation of worst-case performance, robustness in harsh environments, and extensibility when development or adaptation is required. Coverage of such issues helps to draw the advanced concepts arising from academic research back towards the technological concerns of industry. Initial coverage of basic definitions and ideas and a literature review gives way to a treatment of electrical flight control system failures: oscillatory failure, runaway, and jamming. Advanced fault detection and diagnosis for linear and linear-parameter-varying systems are described. Lastly recovery strategies appropriate to remaining actuator/sensor/communications resources are developed. The authors exploit experience gained in research collaboration with academic and major industrial partners to validate advanced fault diagnosis and fault-tolerant control techniques with realistic benchmarks or real-world aeronautical and space systems. Consequently, the results presented in Fault Diagnosis and Fault-Tolerant Control and Guidance for Aerospace, will be of interest in both academic and aerospatial-industrial milieux.},

abstract = {In this paper we study the compensation problem of LQG control over two lossy networks under TCP-like protocols and propose a new static and latest-control based compensation framework. Compared to two popular strategies, the zero-input and hold-input compensators and the recent generalized hold-input compensator by Moayedi et al. [8], [13], our new one is more general. The contribution of the new framework is in three aspects. Firstly, it takes the problem of LQG control over lossy networks to a new level by suggesting that the original problem should be more properly posed as a two-variable instead of a one-variable optimization problem. Secondly, it links the compensator gain selection and the minimization of quadratic cost together and bridges the gap between the two by providing an optimal gain selection. Thirdly, it incorporates the above three classes of compensators as special cases. The issue as to why none of the zero-input and hold-input compensation strategies can be claimed to be better than the other is to a great extent settled. Performance comparisons of the proposed method and the predictive outage compensator by Henriksson et al. [17] and the generalized hold-input strategy by Moayedi et al. [8], [13] are made through numerical examples.},

abstract = {UAVs, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, have gained significant attention recently, due to the increasingly growing range of applications. Most UAVs use radio frequency transmission to communicate with the ground station to receive commands and send data. However, this model of communication restricts the user to being in specific locations and limits missions to narrow areas. This paper proposes a Cloud Computing (CC) integration where the UAVs become part of the cloud infrastructure and can be accessed ubiquitously. This concept is similar to the Internet of Things (IoT) where smart objects are connected to the Internet and are given unique identification. Moreover, to provide an appropriate way of communication, UAV resources are developed as web services. They provide their resources and services through a uniform interface using the RESTful HTTP architecture. This concept is relevant to the Web of Things (WoT) that provides smart objects with interfaces to be accessed through the World Wide Web (WWW). However, in UAVs, not only the web services are computational services but they are also physical elements affecting and affected by the real world environment.},

abstract = {Advances in communication, information technology, and computation have led to a rapid change of today's world. Actuation, communication, sensing, and control are becoming ubiquitous. While this offers many possibilities - Smart cities, Smart buildings, Smart devices, Smart factories, Smart health monitoring a smarter world - there are also several challenges which need to be tackled. How can one handle the increasing complexity? Can one guarantee safety and performance of such networked control systems subject to erroneous communication, delays, and failures of sensors and actuators? Is it possible to design control systems with plug and play capacity? How can one guarantee privacy of the controlled subsystems while exchanging information? Predictive control is a well suited control approach to tackle some of these challenges, since its allows to directly take constraints, preview information, as well as models of the physical world into account.We limit our attention to three areas we believe predictive control methods can have a significant impact: the efficient and easy implementation of predictive control on the omnipresent embedded computation hardware, the control under resource limitations and network effects, and the control on the network level, outlining a contract based control approach which allows a structured, yet flexible hierarchical design.We briefly review results from these fields and outline some solutions related to our work, that provide possible solutions to the considered challenges.},

When faults occur in the actuator, then the elements of the control distribution matrix (control derivatives) change. The Kalman filter (KF) is used in order to identify the control distribution matrix elements; thus, the control reconfiguration is carried out using this identified control distribution matrix. An LQR controller is designed for the modeled UAV. The control derivatives are identified by the KF and LQR controller is reconfigured for the identified control distribution matrix. In simulations, the linearized model of longitudinal dynamics of ZAGI UAV is considered, and the performance of the proposed system identification and reconfigurable control techniques are examined for this model.},

We derive expressions for computing the optimal static gain for both strategies and we compare their performance on some numerical examples. Interestingly, none of the two can be claimed superior to the other, even for simple scalar systems, since there are scenarios where one strategy performs better then the other and scenarios where the converse occurs.},

EMC can be considered as a disturbance rejection control strategy, since the state predictor is extended to explicitly include disturbance dynamics, in charge of predicting the uncertainty to be rejected by control law. Essential in EMC design is the separation between controllable and not controllable dynamics, a task which allows us to find the controllable channel of underactuated systems from the low-dimensional command to the whole system degrees of freedom (DF). Pursuing this objective, a rather generic method is shown, which is applicable to other underactuated systems. The result is a very simple controllable dynamics from the single pendulum command to pendulum DF arranged in a single series of controllable integrators. The neglected feedback channels, including the unstable gravity feedback, are treated as unknown thus posing a challenge to disturbance prediction and closed loop stability. Typical in EMC, closed loop eigenvalues are chosen to guarantee stability, a pre-requisite to performance. Experimental results point out effectiveness and advantage, with respect to LQR, of design and implementation under adverse conditions, due to a disturbance pulse, in which command saturates.}

This paper presents the application of a model-based control structure called Embedded Model Control (EMC) when a hierarchical scheme is implemented on an electro-hydraulic proportional valve. The overall control consists of two hierarchical loops: the inner loop is the solenoid current regulator with a closed loop bandwidth close to 1kHz. The outer loop is a position tracking control, in charge of the accurate positioning of the spool with respect to valve openings. The paper addresses the outer loop, i.e., the tracking of mechanical spool position by using the EMC. Analysis and synthesis are presented as well as experimental results obtained from a test rig provided by an industrial manufacturer.}

	abstract = {Distributed networked control systems have attracted intense attention from both academia and industry due to the multidisciplinary nature among the areas of communication networks, computer science and control. With ever-increasing research trends in these areas, it is desirable to review recent advances and to identify methodologies for distributed networked control systems. This paper presents a brief overview of such systems regarding system configurations, challenging issues and methodologies. First, networked control systems are introduced and their prevalent configurations including centralized, decentralized and distributed structures are outlined. Second, an emphasis is laid on a number of challenging issues from the analysis and synthesis of distributed networked control systems. More specifically, these challenging issues are identified through three integrated aspects: communication, computation and control. Third, different methodologies in the literature for distributed networked control systems are reviewed and categorized based on three pairs: undirected and directed graphs, fixed and time-varying topologies, and time-triggered and event-triggered mechanisms. Finally, concluding remarks are drawn and some potential research directions are suggested.}

	abstract = { In the framework of the networked control systems (NCSs), the components are connected with each other over a shared band-limited network. The merits of NCSs include easy extensibility, resource sharing, high reliability and so forth. However, the insertion of the communication network brings many challenges, such as network-induced phenomena and cyber-security, which should be handled properly. On the other hand, the sliding mode control (SMC) has become an effective scheme for the synthesis of NCSs due to its strong robustness and SMC has wide applications in NCSs. In this paper, some recent advances on SMC for NCSs are reviewed. In particular, some new SMC schemes for NCSs subject to time-delay, packet losses, quantisation and uncertainty/disturbance are summarised firstly. Subsequently, the problem of SMC for NCSs under scheduling protocols is discussed, where different communication protocols are introduced for the energy saving purpose during the synthesis of NCSs. Next, some recent results on SMC for NCSs with actuator/sensor fault and cyber-attack are recalled. Finally, the conclusion is provided and the potential research challenges on SMC for NCSs are pointed out. }

	abstract = {Over the past few decades, robotics technology and applications have attracted considerable interest from many researchers both in academia and industry. This interest mainly covers the development and implementation of control strategies for robotic systems such as adaptive control, robust control, active disturbance rejection control (ADRC), etc. The continuous complexity of physical systems that are being controlled necessitates some practical considerations for the controller design, analysis and implementation. In recent years, the ADRC approach has become a popular control framework adopted in robotic applications due to many advantages such as its simplicity of implementation as well as its robustness and ability to reject varying uncertainties and disturbances. This review paper provides a comprehensive assessment and insights into various ADRC frameworks developed for robotic systems and highlights the basic problems involved in this field. By a thorough review of existing ADRC schemes for robotic systems, recent results of these strategies that have broad implications are classified and analyzed in terms of their structural features and computational complexity. Moreover, we attempt in this review paper to provide a reference source in this area to help researchers and practitioners select a suitable ADRC structure for solving robotic application problems as well as to light up unsolved problems in the field. An example that illustrates the practical application of the linear and nonlinear ADRC to the 4-DOF robotic arm is presented in this review paper.}

	pages={157-168},
	abstract={This paper focuses on a new finite-time convergence disturbance rejection control scheme design for a flexible Timoshenko manipulator subject to extraneous disturbances. To suppress the shear deformation and elastic oscillation, position the manipulator in a desired angle, and ensure the finitetime convergence of disturbances, we develop three disturbance observers (DOs) and boundary controllers. Under the derived DOs-based control schemes, the controlled system is guaranteed to be uniformly bounded stable and disturbance estimation errors converge to zero in a finite time. In the end, numerical simulations are established by finite difference methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of the devised scheme by selecting appropriate parameters.},
