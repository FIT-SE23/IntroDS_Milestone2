  abstract  = {The data bases for low-pressure rate coefficients of the dissociation of O3 and the reverse recombination of O with O2 in the bath gases M = He{,} Ar{,} N2{,} CO2 and SF6 are carefully analyzed. At very high temperatures{,} the rate constants have to correspond solely to the energy transfer (ET) mechanism. On condition that this holds for Ar and N2 near 800 K{,} average energies transferred per collision of −〈ΔE〉/hc = 18 and 25 cm−1 are derived{,} respectively. Assuming an only weak temperature dependence of 〈ΔE〉 as known in similar systems{,} rate coefficients for the ET-mechanism are extrapolated to lower temperatures and compared with the experiments. The difference between measured and extrapolated rate coefficients is attributed to the radical complex (RC) mechanism. The derived rate coefficients for the RC-mechanism are rationalized in terms of equilibrium constants for equilibria of van der Waals complexes of O (or O2) with the bath gases and with rate coefficients for oxygen abstraction from these complexes. The latter are of similar magnitude as rate coefficients for oxygen isotope exchange which provides support for the present interpretation of the reaction in terms of a superposition of RC- and ET-mechanisms. We obtained rate coefficients for the ET-mechanism of kETrec{,}0/[Ar] = 2.3 × 10−34 (T/300)−1.5 and kETrec{,}0/[N2] = 3.5 × 10−34 (T/300)−1.5 cm6 molecule−2 s−1 and rate coefficients for the RC-mechanism of kRCrec{,}0/[Ar] = 1.7 × 10−34 (T/300)−3.2 and kRCrec{,}0/[N2] = 2.5 × 10−34 (T/300)−3.3 cm6 molecule−2 s−1. The data bases for M = He{,} CO2 and SF6 are less complete and only approximate separations of RC- and ET-mechanism were possible. The consequences of the present analysis for an analysis of isotope effects in ozone recombination are emphasized.},

Operating at hydrogen number densities from 10 11 to 10 14 cm −3 , the contributions of radiative, k r , and ternary, k 3 , association have been extracted from the measured apparent binary rate coefficients, k *= k r + k 3 [H 2 ]. Surprisingly, k 3 is constant between 11 and 22 K, (2.6±0.8)×10 −29 cm 6 s −1 , while radiative association decreases from k r (11 K)=(1.6±0.3)×10 −16 cm 3 s −1 to k r (28 K)=(5±2)×10 −17 cm 3 s −1 . These results are in conflict with simple association models in which formation and stabilization of the complex are treated separately. Tentative explanations are based on the fact that, at low temperatures, only few partial waves contribute to the formation of the collision complex and that ternary association with H 2 may be quite inefficient because of the ‘shared proton' structure of .},

  abstract        = {Three-body association coefficients for the conversion of atomic He +, Ne+, and Ar+ ions to molecular ions have been determined using drift-tube mass-spectrometer techniques at gas temperatures from 78 to 300 K. The 300 K results for the conversion of He + to He+ agree well with those obtained by other investigators using various techniques; however at 78 K, our results disagree strongly with one of the previous determinations. In the cases of conversion of Ne+ to Ne+ and Ar+ to Ar2+, the rate coefficients differ substantially for ground state ions in their 2P3/2 and 2P1/2 fine structure states; also, the temperature dependence of this effect is distinctly different for the two gases. It does not appear that available theories give an adequately quantitative description of these association processes. {\textcopyright} 1980 American Institute of Physics.},

As a result, we notice that, independently of the number of particles and interparticle interaction, the capture hyperradial distribution function follows a Fr\'echet distribution, a special type of the generalized extreme value distribution. Besides, we elaborate on the fundamentals of such universal feature using the general extreme value theory, thus, establishing a connection between extreme value theory and few-body physics.},
