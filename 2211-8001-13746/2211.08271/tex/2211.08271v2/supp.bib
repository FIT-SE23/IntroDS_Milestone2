	abstract = {A new parametrisation of the Eilenberger equations of superconductivity in terms of the solutions to a scalar differential equation of the Riccati type is introduced. It is shown that the quasiclassical propagator, and in particular the local density of states, may be reconstructed, without explicit knowledge of any eigenfunctions and eigenvalues, by solving a simple initial value problem for the linearised Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. The Riccati parametrisation of the quasiclassical propagator leads to a stable and fast numerical method to solve the Eilenberger equations. For some spatially varying model pair potentials exact solutions to the Eilenberger Equations are found.},

	abstract = {The stationary behavior of type II superconductors is completely described by Gorkov's equations for a set of four Green's functions, supplemented by two self-consistency equations for gap parameterΔ(r) and vector potentialA(r). Expanding all quantities as usual at the Fermi surface and averaging over impurity positions, this set of equations is transformed into a simpler set for integrated Green's functions (which still contain much more information than is needed in most cases). The resulting equations, when linearized, yield essentially Lüders' transport equation for de Gennes' correlation function. The full equations contain all the known results and provide a promising starting point for numerical calculations.},
