Combined with the measurements of macroscopic magnetization, these results allowed studying the effect of bulk pinning and geometric barrier on the equilibrium structure of the intermediate state. Zero-bulk pinning discs and slabs show hysteretic behavior due to topological hysteresis—flux tubes on penetration and lamellae on flux exit. (Hemi)spheres and cones do not have a geometric barrier and show no hysteresis with flux tubes dominating the intermediate field region in both regimes. It is concluded that flux tubes represent the equilibrium topology of the intermediate state. Real-time video is available in the EPAPS Document No. ..},

	abstract = {The structure and dynamics of froths have been subjects of intense interest owing to the desire to understand the behaviour of complex systems where topological intricacy prohibits exact evaluation of the ground state. The dynamics of a traditional froth involves drainage and drying at the cell boundaries; thus, it is irreversible. Here, we report a new member of the froth family: suprafroth, in which the cell boundaries are superconducting and the cell interior is normal, or non-superconducting. Despite having a very different microscopic origin, topological analysis of the structure of the suprafroth shows that the same statistical laws, such as those of von Neumann and of Lewis apply to a suprafroth. Furthermore, for the first time in the analysis of froths, there is a global measurable property, the magnetic moment, which can be directly related to the suprafroth structure. We propose that this suprafroth is a model system for the analysis of the complex physics of two-dimensional froths—with magnetic field and temperature as external (reversible) control parameters.},

The Debye frequency, the Fermi velocity, and the coupling constant of the electron-electron attractive interaction are used as microscopic input parameters. The resulting quasiparticle-excitation spectrum, the pair potential, and the current distribution are studied as a function of temperature, and can be used to define a coherence length and to determine the magnetic penetration depth. The local density of one-particle excitations, calculated from the quasiparticle amplitudes, explains the results of scanning-tunneling-microscopy (STM) experiments by Hess et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 62, 214 (1989)] on NbSe2. The main spectroscopic features in the experimental results are caused by bound states in the vortex cores. Spatial distortions of the bound-state wave functions caused by neighboring vortices and by the crystalline lattice are discussed in terms of a simplified two-band model. In the case of NbSe2, the resulting local density of states has a characteristic star shape in real space, whose orientation is energy dependent, in agreement with recent STM experiments [Phys. Rev.

We determine the optimal scaling law of the minimal energy in terms of the parameters of the problem, when the applied magnetic field is sufficiently small and the sample sufficiently thick. This optimal scaling law is proven via ansatz-free lower bounds and an explicit branching construction which refines further and further as one approaches the surface of the sample. Two different regimes appear, with different scaling exponents. In the first regime, the branching leads to an almost uniform magnetic field pattern on the boundary; in the second one the inhomogeneity survives up to the boundary.},

One can expect that in this case the flux monsters can escape their “prison” at the Bogomolnyi point, occupying the intertype domain and shaping its internal structure. Our calculations reveal that such exotic flux distributions are indeed stable in the intertype regime of thin superconductors made of a type-I material, where the Bogomolnyi degeneracy is removed by stray magnetic fields. They can be classified into three typical patterns that are qualitatively different from those in types I and II: superconducting islands separated by vortex chains; stripes/worms/labyrinths patterns; and mixtures of giant vortices and vortex clusters. Our findings shed light on the problem of the interchange between types I and II, raising important questions on the completeness of the textbook classification of the superconductivity types.},

Developing a secular perturbation theory, we studied how this degeneracy is lifted when κ is slightly different from 1/√2 or when the GL theory is extended to the higher terms in T−Tc. We constructed a simple secular functional that depends only on few experimentally measurable phenomenological parameters and therefore is quite efficient to study the vortex state of superconductor in this transitional region of κ. On this base, we calculated such vortex state properties as critical fields, energy of the normal-superconductor interface, energy of the vortex lattice, vortex interaction energy, etc., and compared them with previous results that were based on bulky solutions of GL equations.},

In the present work, based on the extended Ginzburg-Landau formalism, we show that the same picture of the two standard types with the transitional domain in between applies also to multiband superconductors. However, the intertype domain notably widens in the presence of multiple bands and can become extremely large when the system has a significant disparity between the band parameters. It is concluded that many multiband superconductors, such as recently discovered borides and iron-based materials, can belong to the intertype regime.},

Quasiparticle wave functions are expected to leak out in the directions of gap minima or nodes, if they exist, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) on these low-energy states should probe the momentum dependence of the gap. Anisotropy can also arise from band-structure effects, however. We perform a quasiclassical calculation of the density of states of a single vortex in an anisotropic superconductor, and show that if the gap itself is not highly anisotropic, the Fermi-surface anisotropy can dominate, preventing direct observation of superconducting gap features.

At yet stronger confinement we discovered the giant vortex phase; the spatial evolution of the excitation tunneling spectra in the cores of these unusual quantum objects was explored.

We can study the impurity effects while keeping the discreteness of the energy spectrum, in contrast to the quasiclassical theory. We can thus apply this scheme to SCs with a small quasiclassical parameter kFξ0 (which is the product of the Fermi wavenumber kF and the coherence length ξ0 in a pure SC at zero temperature) and/or in the superclean regime Δminiτ≫1Δminiτ≫1{\textbackslash}Delta \_\{{\textbackslash}text\{mini\}\}{\textbackslash}tau {\textbackslash}gg 1 (Δmini and τ denote, respectively, the level spacing of the CdGM mode called the minigap and the relaxation time for the CdGM mode and we take ħ = 1).

The perpendicular critical field (H⊥) for thicknesses less than a critical thickness, dc≈15 kÅ, is in good agreement with the theory of Tinkham if it is assumed that the penetration depth is thickness-dependent. The data for thicknesses above dc follow a thickness dependence predicted from the effect of a positive surface energy on the free energy of the intermediate state. At dc there is a minimum in H⊥. The parallel critical field (H∥) up to dc is in good agreement with the theory of Saint James and de Gennes for a second-order transition. Above dc, H∥ agrees with the bulk value of Hc3 for lead. In the vicinity of dc the magnetization curve starts to exhibit a reversible tail which persists to larger thicknesses and whose slope is in reasonable agreement with theory. From the data, the bulk values of κ(T), λ(T), λL(0), and ξ0, as well as the thickness dependence of these quantities, have been computed.},

Reducing the number of components in the system would facilitate the creation of the long-sought Majorana bound states. Here, we explore a route toward emergent topology in a trivial superconductor without a need for other proximitized materials. Speciﬁcally, we show that a vortex hosting an even number of ﬂux quanta is capable of forming a quasi-one-dimensional topological sub-system that can be mapped to the Kitaev wire, if the vortex is trapped at a screw dislocation. This crystallographic defect breaks inversion symmetry and thereby threads a local spin–orbit coupling through the superconductor. The vortex-dislocation pair in the otherwise trivial bulk can harbor a pair of Majorana bound states located at the two surface terminations. We explain the topological transition in terms of a band inversion in the Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon vortex bound states and discuss favorable material parameters.},

	abstract = {‘Accidental’ degeneracies between energy levels Ej and Ej+1 of a real Hamiltonian can occur generically in a family of Hamiltonians labelled by at least two parameters X, Y,... Energy-level surfaces in E, X, Y space have (locally) a double-cone (diabolo) connection and we refer to the degeneracies themselves as ‘diabolical points’. We studied the family of systems in which a particle moves freely within hard-walled triangles (vibrations of triangular membranes), with X and Y labelling two of the angles. Using an efficient Green-function technique to compute the levels, we found several diabolical points for low-lying levels (as well as some symmetry degeneracies); the lowest diabolical point occurred for levels 5 and 6 of the triangle 130.57°, 30.73°, 18.70°. The conical structure was confirmed by noting that the normal derivative u of the wavefunction ψ at a boundary point changed sign during a small circuit of the diabolical point. The form of the variation of u around a circuit, and the changing pattern of nodal lines of ψ, agreed with theoretical expectations. An estimate of the total number of degeneracies Nd(j) involving levels 1 through j, based on the energy-scaling of cone angles and the level spacing distribution, gave Nd(j) {\textasciitilde} (j + ½)2.5, and our limited data support this prediction. Analytical theory confirmed that for thin triangles (where our computational method is slow) there are no degeneracies in the energy range studied.},

In contrast to the transverse collective excitations in ordinary superconductors, the energy of this mode can be derived directly from existing experimental data; for Nb it lies about at the middle of the smaller single-particle gap. Direct experimental detection of this resonance is estimated to be rather beyond the limits of available techniques, but its effect on the ultrasound dispersion curve should be easily observable. The phenomenon is used to elucidate the physical nature of excitons in superconductors in general.},
