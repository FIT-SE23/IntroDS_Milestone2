Such points collectively capture the trade-off among the various conflicting objectives. It is proved that this method is independent of the relative scales of the functions and is successful in producing an evenly distributed set of points in the Pareto set given an evenly distributed set of parameters, a property which the popular method of minimizing weighted combinations of objective functions lacks. Further, this method can handle more than two objectives while retaining the computational efficiency of continuation-type algorithms. This is an improvement over continuation techniques for tracing the trade-off curve since continuation strategies cannot easily be extended to handle more than two objectives.}, number={3}, journal={SIAM Journal on Optimization}, publisher={Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics}, author={Das, Indraneel and Dennis, J.

In this paper, we recognize a few recent efforts and discuss a number of viable directions for developing a potential EMO algorithm for solving many-objective optimization problems. Thereafter, we suggest a reference-point-based many-objective evolutionary algorithm following NSGA-II framework (we call it NSGA-III) that emphasizes population members that are nondominated, yet close to a set of supplied reference points. The proposed NSGA-III is applied to a number of many-objective test problems with three to 15 objectives and compared with two versions of a recently suggested EMO algorithm (MOEA/D). While each of the two MOEA/D methods works well on different classes of problems, the proposed NSGA-III is found to produce satisfactory results on all problems considered in this paper. This paper presents results on unconstrained problems, and the sequel paper considers constrained and other specialties in handling many-objective optimization problems.}, number={4}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation}, author={Deb, Kalyanmoy and Jain, Himanshu}, year={2014}, month={8}, pages={577–601} }

Various evolutionary approaches to multi-objective optimization have been proposed since 1985. Some of fairly recent ones are NSGA-II, SPEA2, PESA (which are included in this study) and others. They all have been mainly applied to two to three objectives. In order to establish their superiority over classical methods and demonstrate their abilities for convergence and maintenance of diversity, they need to be tested on higher number of objectives. In this study, these state-of-the-art MOEAs have been investigated for their scalability with respect to the number of objectives (2 to 8). They have also been compared on the basis of -(1) Their ability to converge to Pareto front, (2) Diversity of obtained non-dominated solutions and (3) Their running time. Four scalable test problems (DTLZ1, 2, 3 and 6) are used for the comparative study.}, booktitle={Evolutionary Multi-Criterion Optimization}, publisher={Springer}, author={Khare, Vineet and Yao, Xin and Deb, Kalyanmoy}, editor={Fonseca, Carlos M. and Fleming, Peter J. and Zitzler, Eckart and Thiele, Lothar and Deb, Kalyanmoy}, year={2003}, pages={376–390}, collection={Lecture Notes in Computer Science}, language={en} }

Optimizer behavior is assessed for a grid of mutation and recombination operator configurations. Performance maps are obtained for the dual aims of proximity to, and distribution across, the optimal tradeoff surface. Performance sweet-spots for both variation operators are observed to contract as the number of objectives is increased. Classical settings for recombination are shown to be suitable for small numbers of objectives but correspond to very poor performance for higher numbers of objectives, even when large population sizes are used. Explanations for this behavior are offered via the concepts of dominance resistance and active diversity promotion.}, number={6}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation}, author={Purshouse, Robin C. and Fleming, Peter J.}, year={2007}, month={Dec}, pages={770–784} }
