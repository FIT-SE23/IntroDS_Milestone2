\begin{abstract}
% Performing physical therapy requires extensive close assessment with therapists' oversight. However, patients have minimal supervision at home to perform therapeutic exercises. In this paper, we propose and investigate a new framework, PhysiQ, a new technique to harness built-in sensors in commodity smartwatches to digitalize exercises in our metrics and provide a valuable assessment to the patients and therapists. PhysiQ evaluates exercises in three different metrics: range of motions, stability, and repetition. PhysiQ recognizes the nuances in exercises, works with different numbers of repetitions, and achieves an accuracy of 87.89\% in classification and an average R-squared correlation of 0.932 in similarity comparison. Finally, a survey is conducted to receive participants' responses to our systems. 
Physical therapy (PT) is crucial for patients to restore and maintain mobility, function, and well-being. Many on-site activities and body exercises are performed under the supervision of therapists or clinicians. However, the postures of some exercises at home cannot be performed accurately due to the lack of supervision, quality assessment, and self-correction. Therefore, in this paper, we design a new framework, PhysiQ, that continuously tracks and quantitatively measures people's off-site exercise activity through passive sensory detection. In the framework, we create a novel multi-task spatio-temporal Siamese Neural Network that measures the absolute quality through classification and relative quality based on an individual's PT progress through similarity comparison. PhysiQ digitizes and evaluates exercises in three different metrics: range of motions, stability, and repetition. 
We collect and annotate 31 participants’ motion data with different levels of quality. 
Evaluation results show that PhysiQ recognizes the nuances in exercises, works with different numbers of repetitions, and achieves an accuracy of 89.67\% in detecting levels of exercise quality and an average R-squared correlation of 0.949 in similarity comparison.

% Performing physical therapy requires extensive close assessment with therapists’ oversight. However, patients have minimal supervision at home to perform therapeutic exercises. In this paper, we propose and investigate a new framework, PhysiQ, a new technique to harness built-in sensors in commodity smartwatches to digitalize exercises in our metrics and provide a valuable assessment to the patients and therapists. PhysiQ evaluates exercises in three different metrics: range of motions, stability, and repetition. PhysiQ recognizes the difference in exercises, works with different numbers of repetitions, and achieves an accuracy of 74.58 and an average R-squared correlation of 0.89674 from 1 to 5 repetitions in similarity comparison. We explore and observe that different metrics and exercises have unique characteristics, and by developing such a model based on Siamese Neural Network with additional spatiotemporal representation encoding, our model can achieve 90 percent R-square correlation and 75 percent accuracy in classification. Moreover, a comprehensive evaluation and user studies are performed to show the effects on our metrics in range of motion, stability, and repetition. Finally, a survey is conducted to receive participants’ responses to our systems.
