Neural networks are highly performant at predicting strawberry yields, here we attain 8\% RMSE with a three-headed transformer ingesting three distinct timelines/ streams. The past, the present, and the future. We collected our own data to fuel these timelines due to the distinct unavailability or impracticality of currently available strawberry yield data. Our multi-timeline approach achieves better performance than humans by a significant margin. However, we also found that there is still an ongoing battle with data availability which still restricts us from certain model architectures due to insufficient data with which to train them.
