Next, we want to examine which part of our designed model contributes the superior performance as analyzed above. 
(1) Why SF not others, just raw state? Or VAE

(2) why use set, not directly SFs?
Number of set elements, 1 --> 50 --> 6000 --> infinity (just SFs)
The performance actually goes up and down. So set structure is better!
