	abstract = {During a disaster or prolonged power outage, individuals who use electricity-dependent medical equipment are often unable to operate it and seek care in acute care settings or local shelters. Public health officials often report that they do not have proactive and systematic ways to rapidly identify and assist these individuals.
            In June 2013, we piloted a first-in-the-nation emergency preparedness drill in which we used Medicare claims data to identify individuals with electricity-dependent durable medical equipment during a disaster and securely disclosed it to a local health department. We found that Medicare claims data were 93\% accurate in identifying individuals using a home oxygen concentrator or ventilator.
            The drill findings suggest that claims data can be useful in improving preparedness and response for electricity-dependent populations.},

Yet many home medical devices (HMEDs, which includes devices referred to as ‘life support equipment’) rely upon a stable and resilient electricity supply. For users of HMEDs, interruptions to electricity supply can compromise treatment, well-being or survival. This paper addresses a challenge critical to the continued innovation in digital health technologies: the reliable supply of electricity. We bridge the current gap between electricity networks and digital health technologies through a novel method for the remote detection of the phase (that is, which part of the network that each house is connected to), in order to eliminate avoidable interruptions to supply for HMED users. We present an unsupervised phase identification algorithm capable of remote phase detection at scale, and without transformer data. This method translates data insights into actionable energy provision for HMED users and other vulnerable customers, enables more accurate management and planning, and improves electricity reliability which is critical for HMED users and the continued advances in digital health technologies.},

	abstract = {The increased awareness regarding the impact of energy consumption on the environment has led to an increased focus on reducing energy consumption. Feedback on the appliance level energy consumption can help in reducing the energy demands of the consumers. Energy disaggregation techniques are used to obtain the appliance level energy consumption from the aggregated energy consumption of a house. These techniques extract the energy consumption of an individual appliance as features and hence face the challenge of distinguishing two similar energy consuming devices. To address this challenge we develop methods that leverage the fact that some devices tend to operate concurrently at specific operation modes. The aggregated energy consumption patterns of a subgroup of devices allow us to identify the concurrent operating modes of devices in the subgroup. Thus, we design hierarchical methods to replace the task of overall energy disaggregation among the devices with a recursive disaggregation task involving device subgroups. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our methods lead to improved performance as compared to baseline. One of our approaches, Greedy based Device Decomposition Method (GDDM) achieved up to 23.8\%, 10\% and 59.3\% improvement in terms of micro-averaged f score, macro-averaged f score and Normalized Disaggregation Error (NDE), respectively.},

Non Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) systems give important information about the household consumption that can be used by the electric utility or the end users. In this work the implementation of an end-to-end NILM system is presented, which comprises a custom high frequency meter and neural-network based algorithms. The present article presents a novel way to include high frequency information as input of neural network models by means of multivariate time series that include carefully selected features. Furthermore, it provides a detailed assessment of the generalization error and shows that this class of models generalize well to new instances of seen-in-training appliances. An evaluation database formed of measurements in two Uruguayan homes is collected and discussion on general unsupervised approaches is provided.},

	abstract = {Many countries are rolling out smart electricity meters. These measure a home's total power demand. However, research into consumer behaviour suggests that consumers are best able to improve their energy efficiency when provided with itemised, appliance-by-appliance consumption information. Energy disaggregation is a computational technique for estimating appliance-by-appliance energy consumption from a whole-house meter signal. To conduct research on disaggregation algorithms, researchers require data describing not just the aggregate demand per building but also the `ground truth' demand of individual appliances. In this context, we present UK-DALE: an open-access dataset from the UK recording Domestic Appliance-Level Electricity at a sample rate of 16 kHz for the whole-house and at 1/6 Hz for individual appliances. This is the first open access UK dataset at this temporal resolution. We recorded from five houses, one of which was recorded for 655 days, the longest duration we are aware of for any energy dataset at this sample rate. We also describe the low-cost, open-source, wireless system we built for collecting our dataset.},

	abstract = {Background: during the eastern Japan earthquake in 2011 and the following prolonged blackout, pediatric patients with home medical devices sought electricity at the pediatric department. We retrospectively studied the effect of this earthquake and the following blackout. Methods: we hand-reviewed pediatric admission records in Tohoku University Hospital for new inpatients attributed to the earthquake from March 11, 2011 to April 12, 2011. A survey by questionnaire regarding the situation during the earthquake was performed for parents of technology-assisted patients. Results: during the study period, 24 pediatric patients were admitted to the pediatric department. Eighteen technology-assisted pediatric patients, including those with home respirators, accounted for 75\% of new pediatric admissions. Patients who were admitted for electricity shortage stayed in the hospital for a mean of 11.0days (3–25days). The questionnaire survey showed that 55\% of technology-assisted patients were admitted to medical centers for evacuation. The majority of patients (89\%) with ventilators were eventually admitted to medical centers during the earthquake. Most of the parents of technology-assisted patients experienced a prolonged petrol shortage and difficulty in communications with medical centers. Conclusion: the current study suggests that technology-assisted pediatric patients with neurological disorders as the primary disease can overwhelm the capacity of hospital inpatient facilities in certain situations. Disaster preparedness should consider assuring power requirements in healthcare facilities and preparing backup power generators lasting for at least 24h for these patients. Preparing alternative measures for emergent electricity and communications could remedy serious conditions during a disaster.},

We propose a new supervised algorithm, which in the learning stage, automatically extracts signature consumption patterns of each device by modeling the device as a mixture of dynamical systems. In order to extract signature consumption patterns of a device corresponding to its different modes of operation, we define appropriate dissimilarities between energy snippets of the device and use them in a subset selection scheme, which we generalize to deal with time-series data. We then form a dictionary that consists of extracted power signatures across all devices. We cast the disaggregation problem as an optimization over a representation in the learned dictionary and incorporate several novel priors such as device-sparsity, knowledge about devices that do or do not work together as well as temporal consistency of the disaggregated solution. Real experiments on a publicly available energy dataset demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves promising results for energy disaggregation.},
