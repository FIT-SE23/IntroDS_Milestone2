\section{Related Work}

The use of machine learning in computer aided design (CAD) has gained significant attention, and only a few works have been proposed in recent literature that develop machine learning approaches. SketchGraphs dataset~\cite{seff2020sketchgraphs} is a collection of sketches extracted from parametric CAD models which begin as two-dimensional (2D) sketches consisting of geometric primitives (e.g., line segments, arcs) and explicit constraints between them (e.g., coincidence, perpendicularity) that form the basis for three-dimensional (3D) construction operations. This dataset has been used for generative model of CAD sketches~\cite{willis2021engineering}, and other applications of learning in physical design~\cite{seff2021vitruvion, para2021sketchgen}.
Building a design grammar has been the subject of other works such as in \citet{zhao2020robogrammar}. There are also many other works that have focused on specific parts such as robot arms \cite{xu2021end} and airfoil design \cite{chen2022learning}. Two key differences between our approach to design and these previous works is: (1) Our focus on a pathway towards deployment by using physically realizable components; (2) The use of transformer models on our design embeddings to directly evaluate performance.


% While these works have seen a lot of success, they are not focused on the pathway towards actual deployment, whereas the focus in our work is to eventually build physically realizable designs by building a procedural generator and transformer model that operate over real components.


% Another example of a CAD dataset that is focused on physical structure is SimJEB \cite{whalen2021simjeb}, which is a dataset of crowdsourced mechanical brackets and accompanying structural simulations. DeepCAD~\cite{wu2021deepcad} is a dataset of 3D shapes corresponding to objects such as flanges, pipes and screws, represented as a sequence of operations used in a CAD framework to generate these shapes. Another dataset for 3D engineering shapes is the ABC dataset~\cite{koch2019abc}, 
% which comprises geometric models, each defined by parametric surfaces and
% associated with accurate ground truth information on the decomposition into patches. Their representation allows resampling the surface data at arbitrary resolutions into a point cloud or mesh. These datasets are excellent resources for their target application domains such as extrapolating 2D sketch to CAD designs, and generating mechanical parts.


% In another line of related work, surrogate-based optimization is widely explored in design optimization, where the goal is to learn a surrogate function to replace often expensive black-box simulators e.g., computational fluid dynamics simulators~\citep{koziel2011surrogate, han2012surrogate, viquerat2021direct}. The surrogate function aims to capture the physical properties of the design environment and reliably evaluate design samples. These approaches tend to be more scalable compared to the black-box optimization approaches~\citep{greenhill2020bayesian, belakaria2020uncertainty, deshwal2021bayesian} by avoiding the expensive black-box evaluation during optimization. Further, if the surrogate function is differentiable e.g., a neural network, the gradients are also available to the optimizer to perform an end-to-end optimization \cite{grabocka2019learning, liu2020unified, sun2021amortized}.
% Our proposed method can leverage these advances in better surrogate modeling for more efficient exploration.

% In contrast to existing methods, the design for physical systems needs to find a diverse set of designs that trade off different objectives and allow further downstream adaptation to new design objectives.
