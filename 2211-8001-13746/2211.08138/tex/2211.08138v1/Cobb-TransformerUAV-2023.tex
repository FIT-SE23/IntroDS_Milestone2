% 2. Emerging Applications of AI

% Emerging applications papers ‘bridge the gap’ between basic AI research and case studies of deployed AI applications, by discussing efforts to apply AI tools, techniques, or methods to real-world problems in novel ways. Emerging applications focus on aspects of AI applications that are not yet sufficiently deployed to be submitted as case studies in the Deployed track.

% This track is distinguished from reports of purely scientific AI research appropriate for AAAI in that the objective of the efforts reported at IAAI should be the potential application of AI technologies, including engineering considerations. A key requirement for papers is to discuss the path forward for achieving deployment of the technology.

% Papers will be judged primarily by the following criteria: significance (of the problem, and the tool or methodology); relevance of AI technology to the problem; innovation; path to deployment; content; evaluation; technical quality; and clarity. Authors are advised to bear these questions in mind while writing their papers. Authors are also advised to consider the novelty of applying AI to the particular problem domain.

% Papers in this track may have up to 6 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references.



\begin{abstract}
Computer-aided design (CAD) is a promising new area for the application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). The current practice of design of cyber-physical systems uses the {\it digital twin} methodology, wherein the actual physical design is preceded by building detailed models that can be evaluated by physics simulation models. These physics models are often slow and the manual design process often relies on exploring near-by variations of existing designs. AI holds the promise of breaking these design silos and increasing the diversity and performance of designs by accelerating the exploration of the design space. In this paper, we focus on the design of electrical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The high-density batteries and purely electrical propulsion systems have disrupted the space of UAV design, making this domain an ideal target for AI-based design. In this paper, we develop an AI Designer that 
% addresses this challenge and 
synthesizes novel UAV designs. Our approach uses a deep transformer model with a novel domain-specific encoding such that we can evaluate the performance of new proposed designs without running expensive flight dynamics models and CAD tools. We demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the overall compute requirements for the design process and accelerates the design space exploration. Finally, we identify future research directions to achieve full-scale deployment of AI-assisted CAD for UAVs.
