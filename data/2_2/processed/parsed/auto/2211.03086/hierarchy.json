For scale uncertainties with a (*) no explicit value was given by the authors. Instead, we estimate it by taking half of the smallest contour interval of that map and dividing it by its minimum brightness temperature. In the same way, zero-level errors with a $(^{\\dagger})$ are estimated by taking half of the smallest contour interval. To give the zero-level errors as a fraction of the average sky temperature, we calculate the latter from Eq.\\ \\ref{eq:Tsky_average}, where we take the average from using all four considered sky models.\tFor indicating in which models the maps are used, we use the following notation: 1 = GSM, 2 = GSM16, 3 = LFSM, 4 = LFmap.
