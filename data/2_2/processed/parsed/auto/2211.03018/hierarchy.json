When the vehicle is far away from any obstacle, it will perfectly track the vehicle-goal line to hit the steering point $p_{steer}$ on the boundary of obstacles where we need to steer for a more open field of view. This phase is illustrated by a solid green arrow connecting the robot's current position to the steering point $p_{steer}$. After that steering, the next consecutive best-cost trajectories (solid green arrows) would form a line parallel to the wall's peripheral until they end up at a visible point $p_{visible}$ where the goal is visible to the vehicle. As formulated in \\ref{eqn:cost_function}, best-cost candidates are collision-free and form the smallest angle with vehicle-goal vector (dash green angle). The entire maneuver is visualized in sub-figure a). The drone needs time to change its heading to the desired angle. Thus, the practical trajectory will be like the one connected by best-direction trajectories, which is illustrated by curved solid arrows in sub-figure b) and c). The remaining black dashed line arrows are rejected candidates in the sampled set. The solid red arrows denote the steering direction, following the steering mechanism proposed in \\ref{subsec_stuck}. From the analysis of sub-figure a), we can also infer that when the vehicle is close to the obstacle, the best path will align and snap to the obstacle's peripheral as shown in sub-figure b) and c)).\n  }\n  \\label{fig:steering}\n\\end{figure*}",
