        "2211.03217_0bdd64a25e77cd9257d75fcc013dddf3": "First, to deal with the intractable marginalization of the intermediate output, it is simpler to apply Monte Carlo approximation to the gradients instead of the loss",
        "2211.03217_aa5821181253cd05dcbf860174c1a4c7": "Second, parallel training is possible for deliberation networks, as long as each pass is trained separately",
        "2211.03217_7925a851d601540362ab631863d56e5e": "Third, regardless of the application, it is essential that when training the parameters of a certain pass, its previous pass runs in free running mode",
        "2211.03217_905ab23a5254b1140044aaf630e814b8": "Finally, for applications where the output is continuous, a guided attention loss can be used to prevent the multi-pass model from degrading into a single-pass model."
