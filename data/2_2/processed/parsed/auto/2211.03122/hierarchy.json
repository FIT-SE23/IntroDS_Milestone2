        "2211.03122_0cd9764ad8201cf919b74a37e6fe387b": "The first step is to convert the original voxel model to SDF",
        "2211.03122_74cb724d6a391f2219037d1f2505cafb": "The conversion provides smoothing for the rough voxel model and reduces memory consumption for further operations",
        "2211.03122_5e0da39ae1aa558a64b99135f9bb8f6a": "The second step is to train LipMLP on the set of objects and to infer LipMLP with parameters that mix the original geometries in some proportions",
        "2211.03122_1f8ee3c5c5ba581eb6656a93d3718a35": "Thus, the problem of building an anatomical atlas is reduced to the problem of shape interpolation, which is solved with neural networks.",
