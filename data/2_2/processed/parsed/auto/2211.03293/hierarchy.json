        "2211.03293_bbd169d4ef6170d778088a4895314fc5": "One area where this complexity manifests is in modeling systems with more physical processes that may operate at differing temporal and spatial scales",
        "2211.03293_e76440edac860f7415414d9fddd8701a": "Recent work in time integration methods has resulted in several new approaches to handling multiphysics systems with disparate time scales, and many of these are being developed into very efficient implementations within numerical libraries",
        "2211.03293_b9fa752f5c4491eb584f57c7a8da66b5": "In the meantime, work in mesh refinement technologies has resulted in highly efficient libraries for handling multiphysics systems with differing spatial scales",
