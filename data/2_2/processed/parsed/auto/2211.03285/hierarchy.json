If the p-value is bold, the difference is significant in the test ($p < 0.01$). The characters `L', `M', `S' and `N' in parentheses indicate that the effect size is large, medium, small, and none, respectively, according to \\cite{A12}. The `+' sign means the fuzzer in the column is superior to AFL++ when compared by rank sum as well as $\\hat{A}_{12}$, and the `-' sign means the opposite.}\n\\begin{tabular}{lllllllllllll}\n \\toprule\n\n  & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{MOpt} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{CMFuzz} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Karamcheti} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{\\HavocMAB{}} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{SLOPT} \\\\\n  \\cmidrule(r){2-3}\\cmidrule(r){4-5}\\cmidrule(r){6-7} \\cmidrule(r){8-9} \\cmidrule(r){10-11}\n  PUT & $p$ & $\\hat{A}_{12}$ & $p$ & $\\hat{A}_{12}$ & $p$ & $\\hat{A}_{12}$ & $p$ & $\\hat{A}_{12}$ & $p$ & $\\hat{A}_{12}$ \\\\\n\\midrule\n\nopenssl\\_x509 & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.82 (+L) & \\textbf{ 0.023 } & 0.71 (+L) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.92 (+L) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.82 (+L) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.91 (+L) \\\\\nre2-2014-12-09 & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.18 (-L) & > 0.1 & 0.37 (-S) & > 0.1 & 0.38 (-S) & > 0.1 & 0.47 (-N) & > 0.1 & 0.52 (+N) \\\\\nproj4-2017-08-14 & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.08 (-L) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.86 (+L) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.99 (+L) & > 0.1 & 0.54 (+N) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.92 (+L) \\\\\nsqlite3\\_ossfuzz & > 0.1 & 0.55 (+N) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.85 (+L) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.93 (+L) & 0.1 & 0.68 (+M) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 1.00 (+L) \\\\\nlibxml2-v2.9.2 & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.08 (-L) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.93 (+L) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.98 (+L) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.97 (+L) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.84 (+L) \\\\\nfreetype2-2017 & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.08 (-L) & 0.094 & 0.33 (-M) & > 0.1 & 0.54 (+N) & > 0.1 & 0.52 (+N) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.79 (+L) \\\\\nlibpcap\\_fuzz\\_both & > 0.1 & 0.57 (+S) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.79 (+L) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.80 (+L) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.87 (+L) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.81 (+L) \\\\\nlibpng-1.2.56 & > 0.1 & 0.42 (-S) & > 0.1 & 0.36 (-M) & > 0.1 & 0.49 (-N) & > 0.1 & 0.56 (+S) & 0.049 & 0.68 (+M) \\\\\nlcms-2017-03-21 & > 0.1 & 0.45 (-N) & \\textbf{ 0.037 } & 0.70 (+M) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.85 (+L) & > 0.1 & 0.37 (-S) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.88 (+L) \\\\\nvorbis-2017-12-11 & > 0.1 & 0.39 (-S) & > 0.1 & 0.56 (+S) & \\textbf{ < 0.001 } & 0.20 (-L) & > 0.1 & 0.62 (+S) & 0.092 & 0.65 (+M) \\\\\n\n\\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\label{tab:statistics}\n\\end{table*}",
