        "2211.03181_7febe4a83151563e869b73388122920b": "In the analysis of multivariate data, it is frequently desirable to employ statistical methods which are insensitive to the presence of outliers in the sample",
        "2211.03181_50e8f326db69a172d206f1ecffb24155": "To address the problem of outliers, it is important to develop robust statistical procedures",
        "2211.03181_9eac779349337b5815b634e30ba35ae6": "Most statistical procedures include explicit or implicit prior assumptions about the distribution of the observations, but often without taking into account the effect of outliers",
        "2211.03181_453748a240dcfd4432f473f49e354e75": "The purpose of this paper is to present a novel robust version of PCA which has some attractive features.",
        "2211.03181_e49c856e534b553d065f1aeb1f5c02b2": "Principal components analysis (PCA) is considered to be one of the most important techniques in statistics",
        "2211.03181_35d6dc91b8d7ac4fa5cc154bd5f98489": "However, the classical version of PCA depends on either a covariance or a correlation matrix, both of which are very sensitive to outliers",
        "2211.03181_955a6fcf347e5ac5c2d1ec0d8a3ca966": "We develop an alternative method to classical PCA, which is far more robust, by using a multivariate Cauchy likelihood to construct a robust principal components (PC) procedure",
        "2211.03181_d5d33eb92f980baf31e775e7206e8bfa": "It is an adaptation of the classic method of PCA obtained by replacing the Gaussian log-likelihood function by the Cauchy log-likelihood function, in a sense that will be explained in section",
        "2211.03181_19a97dcda45ba8d4a927f7d3345f36ca": "Although we do not claim that the interpretation of standard PCA in terms of operations on a Gaussian likelihood is new, see Bolton and Krzanowski, this fact does not appear to have been exploited in the development of a robust PCA procedure, as we do in this paper",
        "2211.03181_4fccaf108c59722490c95eb846412f17": "An important reason for using the multivariate Cauchy likelihood is that this likelihood has only one maximum point, but the single most important motivation is that it leads to a robust procedure",
        "2211.03181_699d590dd35d290b78f8ace0e6574b3a": "In the next section we review briefly some of the techniques employed for estimating parameters and for directing a PCA in ways which are robust against the presence of outliers",
