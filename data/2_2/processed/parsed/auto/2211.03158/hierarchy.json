The two branches of the dynamical phase transition of dynamic facilitation are indicated. The active phase is effectively indistinguishable from the normal liquid. The inactive phase has a lower configurational entropy, which lies close to, but is presumably slightly larger than, that of the crystal. The lower critical point of the active and inactive phases is thus bounded by the liquid and crystal and lies close to $T_k$. Based on \\cite{royall2020jcp}.\n(b) In the Angell plot representation the relaxation time is plotted as a function of inverse temperature $1/T$ for molecular systems and reduced pressure $Z$ for colloids and grains. Data for molecular systems silica and and \\emph{ortho-}terphenyl (OTP) are taken from~\\cite{royall2015physrep}, for glycerol from~\\cite{lunkenheimer2002}, for colloids from~\\cite{hallett2018} and we computed for the purpose of the present review the data for grains. Data for silica is fitted with an Arrhenius law (a straight line in this representation), other systems are fitted with the Vogel-Fulcher-Tamman expression (Eq. \\ref{eqVFT}).\nIn the case of 3d hard sphere--like colloids, and \n2d hard disc--like grains, the reduced pressure $Z$ is determined from the volume fraction $\\phi$ using the Carnahan Starling relation~\\cite{hallett2018,royall2017} and the equilibrium equation of state for bidisperse hard discs~\\cite{barrio2001} respectively. By convention $T_g$ and $Z_g$ are set such that $\\tau_\\alpha/\\tau_0 = 10^{14}$.
