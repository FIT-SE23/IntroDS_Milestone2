Hence, end user data are not used in model training leading to non-personalized and generic one-size-fits-all models.\\\\\n\n\\rowcolor{Gray!15}\nHybrid Model (HM)&\nTraining and testing splits do not have a disjoint set of users. Represent a case where a machine learning model is used by a mobile app user for some time, and data from the user is used in re-training models. Hence, this approach leads to partially personalized models. \\\\\n\n\\hline \n\n\n\\textcolor{black}{Country-Specific} &\n\\textcolor{black}{This approach uses training and testing data from the same country. \n%It is the least diverse approach,\nEach country has its own model, without leveraging data from other countries. As the name indicates, these models are specific to each country (e.g., a model trained in Italy and tested in Italy). Both population-level and hybrid model types can be trained in the country-specific approach.}\\\\\n\n\\rowcolor{Gray!15}\n\\textcolor{black}{Continent-Specific} &\n\\textcolor{black}{This approach uses training and testing data from the same continent. Each continent has its own model, without leveraging data from other continents. As the name indicates, these models are specific to each continent (e.g., a model trained in Europe and tested in Europe). Continent specific approach can be trained with population-level and hybrid models.}\\\\\n\n\n\\textcolor{black}{Country-Agnostic} &\n\\textcolor{black}{This approach assumes that data and models are agnostic to the country. Hence, a trained model can be deployed to any geographical region regardless of the country of training. Country-agnostic approach too can be trained with population-level and hybrid models. There are two types of country-agnostic settings:\\newline (1) Country-Agnostic I: The first setting uses training data from one country, and testing data from another country. This corresponds to the scenario where a model trained a in country already exists, and we need to understand how it would generalize to a new country (e.g. a model trained in Italy and tested in Mongolia). \\newline (2) Country-Agnostic II: The second setting  uses training data from four countries, and testing data from the remaining country. This corresponds to a scenario where the model was already trained with data from several countries, and we need to understand how it would generalize to a new country (e.g. a model trained with data from Italy, Denmark, UK, and Paraguay, and tested in Mongolia).} \\\\\n\n\n\\rowcolor{Gray!15}\n\\textcolor{black}{Multi-Country}&\n\\textcolor{black}{This one-size-fits-all approach uses training data from all eight countries and tests the learned model in all countries. This corresponds to the setting in which multi-country data is aggregated to build a single model. However, this is also how models are typically built without considering aspects such as geographical diversity. Multi-Country models too can be trained with population-level and hybrid approaches.} \\\\\n\n\n\\arrayrulecolor{Gray2}\n\\hline \n\n\n \n\\end{tabular}\n}\n\\end{table*}",
