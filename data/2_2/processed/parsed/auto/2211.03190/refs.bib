  title = {... High-dimensional variable selection for binary data Abstract.},
  journal = {We propose an iterative variable selection scheme for high-dimensional data with binary outcomes. The scheme adopts a structured screen-and-select framework and uses non-local prior-based Bayesian model selection within the same. The structured screening is based on the association of the independent variables with the outcome which is measured in terms of the maximum marginal likelihood estimator. Performance comparison with several well-known methods in terms of true positive rate and false discovery rate shows that our proposed method stands to be a competitive alternative for sparse high-dimensional variable selection with binary outcomes. The method has been implemented within the R package GWASinlps.},
