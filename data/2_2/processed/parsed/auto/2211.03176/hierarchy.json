        "2211.03176_1a8371f4235c0daccf29ea886afd49b3": "In the present work, we have studied the impact of rotation on the ground state of weakly interacting bosonic atoms confined in two-dimensional anharmonic potentials, first in, an elongated trap and, subsequently, in three-fold and four-fold symmetric traps",
        "2211.03176_5a62adc56fb08896307b23fc1a62e683": "Here, the multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree method for bosons, which is particularly suitable to describe many-body properties, is employed to investigate the ground-state energy, density, the depletion and fragmentation, angular momentum, and finally, many-particle variances as a function of the rotation frequency to characterize the correlations present in the system",
        "2211.03176_aeece82193f713c9b4d717b6a37bb747": "In the elongated trap, it is observed that the ground-state density breaks up into two clouds with rotation",
        "2211.03176_1f28f3d8d77d29076a0a94a4bee541c9": "The splitting of the density is followed by the emergence of the two-fold fragmentation",
        "2211.03176_da72ec5e5e04069b3611a37346595c71": "Interestingly, the ground state exhibits opposite anistoropy both for the many-particle position and momentum variances when computed at the many-body and mean-field levels",
        "2211.03176_b05e524d266d98671b798c326b818022": "The rotation squeezes the position variance in the elongated direction and the momentum variance in the narrow direction, thereby producing unique correlations",
        "2211.03176_89f3afc0596eb9f612846a5360604d29": "Finally, a synchronized pattern among the density breakup, eventual fragmentation, acquisition of angular momentum in the condensate, and many-particle variances is observed",
        "2211.03176_c40cb3dc9e8829becd75078075501c01": "When the angular momentum sets in the breakup of density and the many-particle position and momentum variances start to increase",
        "2211.03176_87aacc5c76c4edde4048efb31d3171d9": "For the three-fold and four-fold symmetric traps, the ground-state density eventually splits into three and four clouds, respectively, with the inclusion of the rotation",
        "2211.03176_eada8f6eef1c8867d7aa9a012f7086cc": "Side-by-side, the rotation leads to transition from condensed to three-fold and four-fold fragmented condensates, respectively, at the many-body level of theory",
        "2211.03176_9cb658b5e20c72e48441075475801323": "We find that the depletion, the accumulation of angular momentum, and finally, the increase in the variances of position and momentum follow hand in hand",
        "2211.03176_d81127e0b2b63808428e8479a424c0b6": "The rotating frame in our work can be viewed as a specific case of synthetic gauge fields",
        "2211.03176_148c3062e66a2bae866e215ad737f206": "In future, continuation of this investigation includes the extension of the study in various synthetic gauge fields",
        "2211.03176_a128446d6cc273c5336a16c5e9452acf": "It would be interesting to explore the ground-state breakup, eventual condensation or fragmentation, and finally, various correlations of the condensate in presence of synthetic gauge fields",
        "2211.03176_b691f086f09b246c18ce008326eff22f": "It would be fascinating to discover many-body features beyond the capacity of a",
