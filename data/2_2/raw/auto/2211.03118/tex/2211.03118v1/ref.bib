abstract = {The large-scale storage of hydrogen plays a fundamental role in a potential future hydrogen economy. Although the storage of gaseous hydrogen in salt caverns already is used on a full industrial scale, the approach is not applicable in all regions due to varying geological conditions. Therefore, other storage methods are necessary. In this article, options for the large-scale storage of hydrogen are reviewed and compared based on fundamental thermodynamic and engineering aspects. The application of certain storage technologies, such as liquid hydrogen, methanol, ammonia, and dibenzyltoluene, is found to be advantageous in terms of storage density, cost of storage, and safety. The variable costs for these high-density storage technologies are largely associated with a high electricity demand for the storage process or with a high heat demand for the hydrogen release process. If hydrogen is produced via electrolysis and stored during times of low electricity prices in an industrial setting, these variable costs may be tolerable.}

abstract = {The role of hydrogen in a future energy system with a high share of variable renewable energy sources (VRES) is regarded as crucial in order to balance fluctuations in electricity generation. These fluctuations can be compensated for by flexibility measures such as the expansion of transmission, flexible generation, larger back-up capacity and storage. Salt cavern storage is the most promising technology due to its large storage capacity, followed by pumped hydro storage. For the underground storage of chemical energy carriers such as hydrogen, salt caverns offer the most promising option owing to their low investment cost, high sealing potential and low cushion gas requirement. This paper provides a suitability assessment of European subsurface salt structures in terms of size, land eligibility and storage capacity. Two distinct cavern volumes of 500,000 m3 and 750,000 m3 are considered, with preference being given for salt caverns over bedded salt deposits and salt domes. The storage capacities of individual caverns are estimated on the basis of thermodynamic considerations based on site-specific data. The results are analyzed using three different scenarios: onshore and offshore salt caverns, only onshore salt caverns and only onshore caverns within 50 km of the shore. The overall technical storage potential across Europe is estimated at 84.8 PWhH2, 27\% of which constitutes only onshore locations. Furthermore, this capacity decreases to 7.3 PWhH2 with a limitation of 50 km distance from shore. In all cases, Germany has the highest technical storage potential, with a value of 9.4 PWhH2, located onshore only in salt domes in the north of the country. Moreover, Norway has 7.5 PWhH2 of storage potential for offshore caverns, which are all located in the subsurface of the North Sea Basin.}

The analysis also assesses the costs associated with the transportation of hydrogen by ship or pipeline. The combination of production and transportation costs yields a ranking of cost-optimal supply sources for individual countries. Estimation results suggest that natural gas reforming with carbon capture and storage will be the most cost-efficient low-carbon hydrogen production pathway in the medium term (2020–2030). Production of hydrogen from renewable energy sources could become competitive in the long run (2030–2050) if capital costs decrease significantly. Until 2050, minimum production costs for hydrogen from renewable energy sources could fall to $1.5/kg under central assumptions and to below $1/kg under optimistic assumptions in some regions. The cost-optimal long-term hydrogen supply depends on regional characteristics, such as renewable energy potentials and gas prices. Imports of hydrogen from renewable energy sources are cost-effective where domestic production potential is small and/or cost-intensive. Additionally, good import conditions exist for countries which are connected to prospective low-cost exporters via existing natural gas pipelines that can be retrofitted to transport hydrogen. Due to the high cost of seaborne transport, hydrogen trade will most likely develop regionally along pipeline networks.}

By-product hydrogen production also conserves energy while natural gas-based, coal-based, and grid power-based hydrogen pathways have no advantages in terms of life-cycle energy consumption. Similar results for life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions are found. Private-passenger fuel-cell vehicles fueled by hydropower-based and nuclear power-based hydrogen have outstanding potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while those fueled by natural-gas-based hydrogen (with life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions ranging 187–235 g CO2,eq/km) are comparable to conventional vehicles. Fuel-cell vehicles fueled by current grid power-based hydrogen have two to three times the life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of internal combustion engine vehicles.

We consider peer-to-peer transactions between renewable energy-based suppliers, profit-driven retailers, and transportation costs. A game model is proposed to characterize the market equilibrium taking into account the strategic behaviors of individual participants. The uncertainty of available renewable energy is described by an inexact probability distribution, and suppliers’ problems give rise to distributionally robust optimization. The market clearing price is endogenously determined from the supply and demand, precipitating an equilibrium in the market. Based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions and linearization techniques, a mixed-integer linear program is developed to compute the market equilibrium. Case studies and numerical analysis conducted on a testing system demonstrate that the proposed method can provide useful insights on hydrogen market design and analysis.}

However, the overall value of these technologies is vigorously debated. Value chain optimisation can determine how carbon dioxide and hydrogen technologies will fit into existing value chains in the energy and chemicals sectors and how effectively they can assist in meeting climate change targets. This is the first study to model and optimise the integrated value chains for carbon dioxide and hydrogen, providing a whole-system assessment of the role of CCUS and hydrogen technologies within the energy system. The results show that there are opportunities for CCUS to decarbonise existing power generation capacity but long-term decarbonisation and flexibility can be achieved at lower cost through renewables and hydrogen storage. Methanol produced from carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) becomes profitable at a price range of £72–102/MWh, compared to a current market price of about £52/MWh. However, this remains well below existing prices for transport fuels, so there is an opportunity to displace existing fuel demands with CCU products. Nonetheless, the scope for decarbonisation from these CCU pathways is small. For investment in carbon capture and storage to become attractive, additional drivers such as decarbonisation of industry and negative emissions policies are required. The model and the insights presented in this paper will be valuable to policymakers and investors for assessing the potential value of the technologies considered and the policies required to incentivise their uptake.}

The overall objective of this work is to perform single objective and multi-objective optimizations for HMSC design to provide effective support for deployment scenarios. The methodological framework developed is based on a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach with augmented ε-constraint implemented in the GAMS environment according to a multi-period approach (2035-2050). Several available energy sources (wind, PV, hydro, national power grid, and natural gas) for hydrogen production through electrolysis and SMR are included. Carbon dioxide sources stem mainly from methanization and gasification processes, which are used to produce methane through methanation. The objective to be minimised in the single optimization approach is the total annual cost considering the externality of greenhouse gas emissions through the carbon price for the whole HMSC over the entire period studied. The multi-objective optimization includes as objectives the total annual cost, greenhouse gas emissions, and the total methane production from methanation. The Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), and the greenhouse gas emissions for each energy carrier are also computed. The results show that renewable hydrogen from PtG can be competitive with SMR through the implementation of carbon prices below 0.27 €/kgCO2. In the case of synthetic methane, the available resources can meet the demand through PtG, and even if synthetic methane for natural gas network injection is thus far from competitive with natural gas, power-to-gas technologies have the potential to decarbonize the fossil economy and achieve a circular economy through CO2 recovery.}

abstract = {Traditional hydrogen production is primarily based on coal gasification in China, and it faces severe challenges relating to its high energy consumption and carbon emissions. Coke oven gas-based hydrogen (COGH) promises to be a potential alternative route for producing coal gasification-based hydrogen (CGH) due to the large-scale coking industry in China. Therefore, it is imperative to understand which route is better. In this study, a life cycle model is developed to compare the energy consumption, carbon emissions and economic cost of the two routes. The model boundary covers all processes from raw material extraction to hydrogen production. Four allocation scenarios (viz. market value allocation, mass allocation, energy allocation and no allocation) are considered to address the burden allocation between various products involved in the coal coking process. Furthermore, the effects of variations in several key parameters on the performance of the two routes are investigated through a sensitivity analysis. The results show that COGH has better technical, environmental and economic performance than CGH. The energy consumption, carbon emissions, capital expenditure and operating expenditure of COGH are 34.6\%, 36.7\%, 27.4\% and 8.7\% lower than those of CGH, while the profit and internal rate of return of COGH are 1.35 and 2.33 times those of CGH. Aside from no allocation, market value allocation is most favourable for COGH in view of its reduced energy consumption and carbon emissions. Compared with CGH, COGH has much stronger economic competitiveness in the face of raw material price fluctuations. This alternative route has broad development prospects because of its excellent comprehensive performance and large-scale industrial base, while efficiency improvements and energy savings should always be considered. The results provide a comprehensive and valuable basis for comparing the strengths and weaknesses of the two routes and to help policymakers take measures to promote the development of the hydrogen production industry.}

Blockchain cross-chain interoperability technology can ensure seamless and effective performance of the proposed pricing mechanism.

We consider hydrogen production based on several feedstocks and energy sources, namely water with electricity, natural gas and biomass. When using natural gas, we couple hydrogen production with carbon capture and storage. The design of the hydrogen, biomass and carbon dioxide (CO2) infrastructure is performed by solving an optimization problem that determines the optimal selection, size and location of the hydrogen production technologies, and the optimal structure of the hydrogen, biomass and CO2 networks. First, we investigate the rationale behind the optimal design of low-carbon hydrogen supply chains by referring to an idealized system configuration and by performing a parametric analysis of the most relevant design parameters of the supply chains, such as biomass availability. This allows drawing general conclusions, independent of any specific geographic features, about the minimum-cost and minimum-emissions system designs and network structures. Moreover, we analyze the Swiss case study to derive specific guidelines concerning the design of hydrogen supply chains deploying carbon capture and storage. We assess the impact of relevant design parameters, such as location of CO2 storage facilities, techno-economic features of CO2 capture technologies, and network losses, on the optimal supply chain design and on the competition between the hydrogen and CO2 networks. Findings highlight the fundamental role of biomass (when available) and of carbon capture and storage for decarbonizing hydrogen supply chains while transitioning to a wider deployment of renewable energy sources.}

abstract = {In the recent decade, the design of green hydrogen supply chains has been highlighted by researchers. Although, nowadays, responsiveness and social responsibility of networks could also be regarded as important measures that could attract more consumers to use hydrogen. Accordingly, this paper aims to improve the reliability and social responsibility of a hydrogen supply chain along with its economic and environmental aspects. To ensure the network's responsiveness, a new objective function is extended that maximizes the reliability of products' delivery. Also, a novel reliability approach is developed to immune the network against disruptions. As a new sustainability indicator, social factors are considered in the design of the hydrogen supply chain. Finally, a mixed possibilistic flexible programming method is proposed to assure the outputs' reliability. The results illustrate that by 28.4\% enhancement in cost objective, the value of environmental, social, and reliability objectives are desirably improved 39.2\%, 45.6\%, and 24.1\%, respectively.}

abstract = {This study involves the construction of a hydrogen supply chain optimization model using a centralized storage model that combines and consolidates flows of hydrogen from different production sites into integrated bulk storage. To supply hydrogen to a fuel cell electric vehicle station, various hydrogen supply pathways and storage configurations for different types of production technologies and transportation modes are considered. In terms of the topological structure, the centralized storage model requires fewer storage areas than the decentralized storage model. The results show that a hydrogen supply chain with a centralized storage structure advances the phase transition of central hydrogen production plants and reduces the total annual cost of the entire supply chain. The optimal hydrogen pathway is on-site steam methane reforming production in the early markets for fuel-cell electric vehicles. However, in matured markets, hydrogen is liquefied in central production plants and stored in bulk storages equipped with vaporizers. Then, the hydrogen is distributed from the central storage areas to local refueling stations via pipelines. The role of central storage areas is predicted to become important as market shares of fuel cell electric vehicle reach 15–30%; in other words, 0.28–0.56 million tonne/year of hydrogen will be demanded in 20 cities of South Korea.}

abstract = {Hydrogen is considered to be one of the fuels of future and liquid hydrogen (LH2) technology has great potential to become energy commodity beyond LNG. However, for commercial widespread use and feasibility of hydrogen technology, it is of utmost importance to develop cost-effective and safe technologies for storage and transportation of LH2 for use in stationary applications as well as offshore transportation. This paper reviews various aspects of global hydrogen supply chain starting from several ways of production to storage and delivery to utilization. While each these aspects contribute to the overall success and efficiency of the global supply chain, storage and delivery/transport are the key enablers for establishing global hydrogen technology, especially while current infrastructure and technology are being under development. In addition, while all storage options have their own advantages/disadvantages, the LH2 storage has unique advantages due to the familiarity with well-established LNG technology and existing hydrogen technology in space programs. However, because of extremely low temperature constraints, commercialization of LH2 technology for large-scale storage and transportation faces many challenges, which are discussed in this paper along with the current status and key gaps in the existing technology.}

In this paper, the integration of this renewable source in a hydrogen supply chain has been analysed with the following considerations, (1) the techno-economic modeling is applied over the 2020–2050 period, at a regional scale comprising the north of Spain, covering the main sources of surplus hydrogen in the region, (2) the supply chain feeds fuel cell devices powering stationary and mobile applications and, thereby stablishing the quality standards for the upcycled hydrogen and, (3) a mixed-integer programming model (MILP) is formulated to predict the optimal integration of surplus hydrogen. The advantages of this research are twofold, (i) on the one hand, it provides the methodology for the optimal use of surplus hydrogen gases promoting the shift to a Circular Economy and, (ii) on the other hand, it contributes to the penetration of renewable energies in the form of low cost fuel cell devices to power stationary and mobile applications. The results show that the combination of all the infrastructure elements into the mathematical formulation yields optimal solutions with a plan for the gradual infrastructure investments over time required for the transition towards a sustainable future energy mix that includes hydrogen. Thus, this work contributes to improving the environmental and economic sustainability of hydrogen supply chains of upcycling industrial surplus hydrogen.}

However, the levelized cost of hydrogen is expensive in the early market due to the absence of infrastructure. In the present study, our aim was to minimize the capital and operating costs of the hydrogen supply chain (HSC) using multi-period mixed-integer linear programming. The proposed HSC includes existing infrastructure for byproduct hydrogen and natural gas (NG) pipelines. We determined the economic benefits of utilizing NG pipelines and byproduct hydrogen and how existing infrastructure outperformed other technologies for the optimization of the HSC. Compared to the non-utilization scenario, the average levelized costs of hydrogen decreased by 0.93, 1.40, and 2.03 \$/kg–H2 if byproduct hydrogen, NG pipelines, or both were available, respectively, in the HSC. The optimal HSC networks indicate that NG pipelines and byproduct hydrogen have synergetic effects on reducing the total costs owing to the decentralization of production facilities.}

The model includes hydrogen grades and separation/purification technologies, offering the possibility to assess the effects that hydrogen grades play in the development of cost-effective hydrogen supply chains, including the decisions to repurpose gas distribution networks or blending hydrogen into them. The model is implemented in a case study of Great Britain, for a set of decarbonisation and learning rate scenarios. A base case with a medium carbon price scenario shows that the total discounted cost of the hydrogen supply chain is significantly higher than shown in previous studies, largely due to the additional costs from purification/separation needed to meet hydrogen purity standards for transport applications. Furthermore, it was shown that producing hydrogen from steam methane reforming with carbon capture and storage; installing new transmission pipelines; repurposing the gas distribution network to supply 100% hydrogen; and purifying hydrogen with a pressure swing adsorption system locally at the refuelling station; is a cost optimal configuration for the given technoeconomic assumptions, providing hydrogen at £6.18 per kg at the pump. Purification technologies were found to contribute to 14% and 30% of total discounted investment and operation costs respectively, highlighting the importance of explicitly including them into hydrogen supply chain models for the transport sector.}

abstract = {The world-wide sustainability implications of transport technologies remain unclear because their assessment often relies on metrics that are hard to interpret from a global perspective. To contribute to filling this gap, here we apply the concept of planetary boundaries (PBs), i.e., a set of biophysical limits critical for operating the planet safely, to address the optimal design of sustainable fuel supply chains (SCs) focusing on hydrogen for vehicle use. By incorporating PBs into a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP), we identify SC configurations that satisfy a given transport demand while minimising the PBs transgression level, i.e., while reducing the risk of surpassing the ecological capacity of the Earth. On applying this methodology to the UK, we find that the current fossil-based sector is unsustainable as it transgresses the energy imbalance, CO2 concentration, and ocean acidification PBs heavily, i.e., five to 55-fold depending on the downscale principle. The move to hydrogen would help to reduce current transgression levels substantially, i.e., reductions of 9–86\% depending on the case. However, it would be insufficient to operate entirely within all the PBs concurrently. The minimum impact SCs would produce hydrogen via water electrolysis powered by wind and nuclear energy and store it in compressed form followed by distribution via rail, which would require as much as 37TWh of electricity per year. Our work unfolds new avenues for the incorporation of PBs in the assessment and optimisation of energy systems to arrive at sustainable solutions that are entirely consistent with the carrying capacity of the planet.}
