\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we proposed KGTN-ens, which builds on KGTN and allows the incorporation of multiple knowledge sources in order to achieve better performance.
We evaluated KGTN-ens on the ImageNet-FS dataset and showed that it outperforms KGTN in most of the tested settings.
We also evaluated Wikidata embeddings in the same task and showed that they are not as effective as the other embeddings.
We believe that the proposed approach can be used in other few-shot learning tasks and we plan to test it in the future.
Although not publicly available at the time of writing this article, further work might include an evaluation of the proposed approach on ImageNet-6K dataset \cite[]{chen2020knowledge}.
A certain limitation of this study is the fact that it might not scale well for extreme classification problems, due to the calculation of pairwise distances of nodes from large knowledge graphs requiring quadratic memory complexity.
