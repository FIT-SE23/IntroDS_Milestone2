abstract = {An overview of the recent developments in the field of cylindrical vector beams is               provided. As one class of spatially variant polarization, cylindrical vector beams               are the axially symmetric beam solution to the full vector electromagnetic wave               equation. These beams can be generated via different active and passive methods.               Techniques for manipulating these beams while maintaining the polarization symmetry               have also been developed. Their special polarization symmetry gives rise to unique               high-numerical-aperture focusing properties that find important applications in               nanoscale optical imaging and manipulation. The prospects for cylindrical vector               beams and their applications in other fields are also briefly discussed.},

The expression for noninteger-order 2D derivatives is given in terms of the Fourier transform which suggests its optical implementation using Fourier optics techniques. We propose an oblique illumination geometry of a 4f correlator to achieve real Fourier plane differentiating filters. In computer simulations, we prove that only in the case of the semiderivative filter, the output intensity is directly proportional to the first derivative of an input phase object. Thus, the semiderivative filter allows exact visualization of phase changes. We show experimental results of differentiation with the first- and -order derivative real filters.}

abstract = {A new microscope imaging system, modulation contrast, has been devised that reveals phase gradients; the image intensity is proportional to the first derivative of the optical density in the object. The modulator, a special filter, is placed in the Fourier plane, a plane conjugate with a slit aperture. The image of the slit aperture is registered within a gray region of the modulator; on one side of the gray region is a region of low transmittance and on the other side, a region of maximum transmittance. The modulator processes opposite gradients to produce opposite intensities, creating an optical shadowing effect. The dark region may be outside the optical system when the gray region is offset to the edge of the Fourier plane, to achieve maximum resolution. Modulation contrast is directional and capable of optical sectioning, revealing details without obscuring effects of structures above and below the plane of focus. The imaging theory of microscope optics has been extended to include effects of phase gradients. Phase gradients distribute the zero order across the Fourier plane. Intensity of the gradient's image is controlled by the zero order of the gradient diffraction pattern.},

abstract = {Schlieren systems with a coherent light source were investigated by the Fourier optics technique. The imaging properties of the systems with various cutoff filters were studied. Systems with a graded piecewise linear filter and a Gaussian step function convolution (graded) filter are considered, demonstrating that the image can be approximated by the geometrical-optics theory of conventional schlieren systems. A nonlinear phase contribution was estimated, allowing for the measurement of strong phase objects. Within the framework of linear approximation the results are described by the phase derivative point-spread function, introduced in this paper as the schlieren point-spread function. In addition, modification of the Lopez cutoff filter is proposed, demonstrating its superiority over the piecewise linear and the Gaussian step convolution filters. Simulations of coherent schlieren imaging as well as phase derivative measurements were performed. Finally, the imaging properties of the schlieren systems with the different filters are compared.},

abstract = {Fringe patterns from optical metrology systems need to be demodulated to get the desired parameters. Two-dimensional windowed Fourier transform is chosen for the determination of phase and phase derivatives. Two algorithms, one based on filtering and the other based on similarity measure, are developed. Some applications based on these two algorithms are explored, including strain determination, phase unwrapping, phase-shifter calibration, fault detection, edge detection and fringe segmentation. Various examples are given to demonstrate the ideas. Finally implementations of these algorithms are addressed. Most of the work has appeared in various papers and its originality is not claimed. Instead, this paper gives an overview and more insights of our work on windowed Fourier transform.}
