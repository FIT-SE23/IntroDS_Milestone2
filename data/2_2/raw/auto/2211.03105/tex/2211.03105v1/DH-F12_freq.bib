Abstract  ="We Present the GMTKN55 Benchmark Database for General Main Group Thermochemistry{,} Kinetics and Noncovalent Interactions. Compared to Its Popular Predecessor GMTKN30 [Goerigk and Grimme J. Chem. Theory Comput.{,} 2011{,} 7{,} 291]{,} It Allows Assessment Across a Larger Variety of Chemical Problems-With 13 New Benchmark Sets Being Presented for the First Time-And It Also Provides Reference Values of Significantly Higher Quality for Most Sets. GMTKN55 Comprises 1505 Relative Energies Based on 2462 Single-Point Calculations and It Is Accessible to the User Community via a Dedicated Website. Herein{,} We Demonstrate the Importance of Better Reference Values{,} and We Re-Emphasise the Need for London-Dispersion Corrections in Density Functional Theory (DFT) Treatments of Thermochemical Problems{,} Including Minnesota Methods. We Assessed 217 Variations of Dispersion-Corrected and -Uncorrected Density Functional Approximations{,} and Carried Out a Detailed Analysis of 83 of Them to Identify Robust and Reliable Approaches. Double-Hybrid Functionals Are the Most Reliable Approaches for Thermochemistry and Noncovalent Interactions{,} and They Should Be Used Whenever Technically Feasible. These Are{,} in Particular{,} DSD-BLYP-D3(BJ){,} DSD-PBEP86-D3(BJ){,} and B2GPPLYP-D3(BJ). The Best Hybrids Are [Small Omega]B97X-v{,} M052X-D3(0){,} and [Small Omega]B97X-D3{,} but We Also Recommend PW6B95-D3(BJ) as the Best Conventional Global Hybrid. At the Meta-Generalised-Gradient (Meta-GGA) Level{,} the SCAN-D3(BJ) Method Can Be Recommended. Other Meta-GGAs Are Outperformed by the GGA Functionals revPBE-D3(BJ){,} B97-D3(BJ){,} and OLYP-D3(BJ). We Note That Many Popular Methods{,} Such as B3LYP{,} Are Not Part of Our Recommendations. In Fact{,} With Our Results We Hope to Inspire a Change in the User Community{'}s Perception of Common DFT Methods. We Also Encourage Method Developers to Use GMTKN55 for Cross-Validation Studies of New Methodologies."}

Abstract  ="a Thorough Energy Benchmark Study of Various Density Functionals (DFs) Is Carried Out With the New GMTKN30 Database for General Main Group Thermochemistry{,} Kinetics and Noncovalent Interactions [Goerigk and Grimme{,} J. Chem. Theor. Comput.{,} 2010{,} 6{,} 107; Goerigk and Grimme{,} J. Chem. Theor. Comput.{,} 2011{,} 7{,} 291]. In Total{,} 47 DFs Are Investigated: Two LDAs{,} 14 GGAs{,} Three Meta-GGAs{,} 23 Hybrids and Five Double-Hybrids. Besides the Double-Hybrids{,} Also Other Modern Approaches{,} i.e.{,} the M05 and M06 Classes of Functionals and Range-Separated Hybrids{,} Are Tested. For Almost All Functionals{,} the New DFT-D3 Correction Is Applied in Order to Consistently Test the Performance Also for Important Noncovalent Interactions; The Parameters Are Taken From Previous Works or Determined for the Present Study. Basis Set and Quadrature Grid Issues Are Also Considered. The General Aim of the Study Is to Work Out Which Functionals Are Generally Well Applicable and Robust to Describe the Energies of Molecules. In Summary{,} We Recommend on the GGA Level the B97-D3 and revPBE-D3 Functionals. The Best Meta-GGA Is oTPSS-D3 Although Meta-GGAs Represent in General No Clear Improvement Compared to Numerically Simpler GGAs. Notably{,} the Widely Used B3LYP Functional Performs Worse Than the Average of All Tested Hybrids and Is Also Very Sensitive to the Application of Dispersion Corrections. We Discourage Its Usage as a Standard Method Without Closer Inspection of the Results{,} as It Still Seems to Be Often Done Nowadays. Surprisingly{,} Long-Range Corrected Exchange Functionals Do in General Not Perform Better Than the Corresponding Standard Hybrids. However{,} the [Small Omega]B97X-D Functional Seems to Be a Promising Method. The Most Robust Hybrid Is Zhao and Truhlar{'}s PW6B95 Functional in Combination With DFT-D3. If Higher Accuracy Is Required{,} Double-Hybrids Should Be Applied. The Corresponding DSD-BLYP-D3 and PWPB95-D3 Variants Are the Most Accurate and Robust Functionals of the Entire Study. Additional Calculations With MP2 and and Its Spin-Scaled Variants SCS-MP2{,} S2-MP2 and SOS-MP2 Revealed That Double-Hybrids in General Outperform Those. Only SCS-MP2 Can Be Recommended{,} Particularly for Reaction Energies. We Suggest Its Usage When a Large Self-Interaction Error Is Expected That Prohibits Usage of Double-Hybrids. Perdews{'} Metaphoric Picture of Jacob{'}s Ladder for the Classification of Density Functionals{'} Performance Could Unbiasedly Be Confirmed With GMTKN30. We Also Show That There Is No Statistical Correlation Between a Functional{'}s Accuracy for Atomization Energies and the Performance for Chemically More Relevant Reaction Energies."}

Among the Tested Hybrid DFT Methods Without Kinetic Energy Density, MPW1K Is the Most Accurate Model for Calculations of Barrier Heights. Among the Tested Hybrid Meta DFT Methods, BB1K and MPWB1K Are the Two Most Accurate Models for the Calculations of Barrier Heights. Overall, the Results Show That BB1K and MPWB1K Are the Two Best DFT Methods for Calculating Barrier Heights, Followed in Order by MPW1K, MPWKCIS1K, B1B95, MPW1B95, BH and HLYP, B97-2, mPW1PW91, and B98. The Popular B3LYP Method Has a Mean Unsigned Error Four Times Larger Than That of BB1K. Of the Methods Tested, QCISD(T) Is the Best Ab Initio WFT Method for Barrier Height Calculations, and QCISD Is Second Best, but QCISD Is Outperformed by the BB1K, MPWB1K, MPWKCIS1K, and MPW1K Methods.},

@ARTICLE{mb08,
Abstract = {a Diversity-Oriented Approach for the Generation of Thermochemical Benchmark Sets Is Presented. Test Sets Consisting of Randomly Generated “Artificial Molecules” (AMs) Are Proposed That Rely on Systematic Constraints Rather Than Uncontrolled Chemical Biases. In This Way, the Narrow Structural Space of Chemical Intuition Is Opened Up and Electronically Difficult Cases Can Be Produced in an Unforeseeable Manner. For the Calculation of Chemically Meaningful Relative Energies, AMs Are Systematically Decomposed Into Small Molecules (Hydrides and Diatomics). Two Different Example Test Sets Containing Eight-Atom, Single-Reference, Main Group AMs With Chemically Very Diverse and Unusual Structures Are Generated. Highly Accurate All-Electron, Estimated CCSD(T)/Complete Basis Set Reference Energies Are Also Provided. They Are Used to Benchmark the Density Functionals S-VWN, BP86, B-LYP, B97-D, PBE, TPSS, PBEh, BH-LYP, B3-PW91, B3-LYP, B2-PLYP, B2GP-PLYP, BMK, MPW1B95, M05, M05-2X, PW6B95, M06, M06-L, and M06-2X. In Selected Cases, an Empirical Dispersion Correction (DFT-D) Has Been Applied. Due to the Composition of the Sets, It Is Expected That a Good Performance Indicates “Robustness” in Many Different Chemical Applications. The Results of a Statistical Analysis of the Errors for the Entire Set With 165 Entries (Average Reaction Energy of 117 Kcal/Mol, Dubbed as the MB08-165 Set) Perfectly Fit to the “Jacob's Ladder” Metaphor for the Ordering of Density Functionals According to Their Theoretical Complexity. The Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) Decreases Very Strongly From LDA (20 Kcal/Mol) to GGAs (MAD of About 10 Kcal/Mol) but Then Was Less Pronounced to Hybrid-GGAs (MAD of About 6−8 Kcal/Mol). The Best Performance (MAD of 4.1−4.2 Kcal/Mol) Is Found for the (Fifth-Rung) Double-Hybrid Functionals B2-PLYP-D and B2GP-PLYP-D, Followed by the M06-2X Meta-Hybrid (MAD of 4.8 Kcal/Mol). The Significance of the Proposed Approach for Thermodynamic Benchmarking Is Discussed and Related to the Observed Performance Ranking Also Regarding Wave Function Based Methods.},

Abstract = {an Efficient Implementation of the Orbital-Optimized Second-Order M{\O}ller−Plesset Perturbation Theory (OO-MP2) Within the Resolution of the Identity (RI) Approximation Is Reported. Both Conventional MP2 and Spin-Component Scaled (SCS-MP2) Variants Are Considered, and an Extensive Numerical Investigation of the Accuracy of These Approaches Is Presented. This Work Is Closely Related to Earlier Work of Lochan, R. C.; Head-Gordon, M. J. Chem. Phys. 2007, 126. Orbital Optimization Is Achieved by Making the Hylleraas Functional Together With the Energy of the Reference Determinant Stationary With Respect to Variations of the Double Excitation Amplitudes and the Molecular Orbital Rotation Parameters. A Simple Iterative Scheme Is Proposed That Usually Leads to Convergence Within 5−15 Iterations. The Applicability of the Method to Larger Molecules (Up to ∼1000−2000 Basis Functions) Is Demonstrated. The Numerical Results Show That OO-SCS-MP2 Is a Major Improvement in Electronically Complicated Situations, Such as Represented by Radicals or by Transition States Where Spin Contamination Often Greatly Deteriorates the Quality of the Conventional MP2 and SCS-MP2 Methods. The OO-(SCS-)MP2 Approach Reduces the Error by a Factor of 3−5 Relative to the Standard (SCS-)MP2. For Closed-Shell Main Group Elements, No Significant Improvement in the Accuracy Relative to the Already Excellent SCS-MP2 Method Is Observed. In Addition, the Problems of All MP2 Variants With 3d Transition-Metal Complexes Are Not Solved by Orbital Optimization. The Close Relationship of the OO-MP2 Method to the Approximate Second-Order Coupled Cluster Method (CC2) Is Pointed Out. Both Methods Have Comparable Computational Requirements.

Abstract = {the Reaction Energies for 34 Typical Organic Isomerizations Including Oxygen and Nitrogen Heteroatoms Are Investigated With Modern Quantum Chemical Methods That Have the Perspective of Also Being Applicable to Large Systems. The Experimental Reaction Enthalpies Are Corrected for Vibrational and Thermal Effects, and the Thus Derived "Experimental" Reaction Energies Are Compared to Corresponding Theoretical Data. A Series of Standard AO Basis Sets in Combination With Second-Order Perturbation Theory (MP2, SCS-MP2), Conventional Density Functionals (e.g., PBE, TPSS, B3-LYP, MPW1K, BMK), and New Perturbative Functionals (B2-PLYP, mPW2-PLYP) Are Tested. In Three Cases, Obvious Errors of the Experimental Values Could Be Detected, and Accurate Coupled-Cluster [CCSD(T)] Reference Values Have Been Used Instead. It Is Found That Only Triple-Zeta Quality AO Basis Sets Provide Results Close Enough to the Basis Set Limit and That Sets Like the Popular 6-31G(D) Should Be Avoided in Accurate Work. Augmentation of Small Basis Sets With Diffuse Functions Has a Notable Effect in B3-LYP Calculations That Is Attributed to Intramolecular Basis Set Superposition Error and Covers Basic Deficiencies of the Functional. The New Methods Based on Perturbation Theory (SCS-MP2, X2-PLYP) Are Found to Be Clearly Superior to Many Other Approaches; That Is, They Provide Mean Absolute Deviations of Less Than 1.2 Kcal Mol-1 and Only a Few Outliers. The Best Performance in the Group of Conventional Functionals Is Found for the Highly Parametrized BMK Hybrid Meta-GGA. Contrary to Accepted Opinion, Hybrid Density Functionals Offer No Real Advantage Over Simple GGAs. For Reasonably Large AO Basis Sets, Results of Poor Quality Are Obtained With the Popular B3-LYP Functional That Cannot Be Recommended for Thermochemical Applications in Organic Chemistry. The Results of This Study Are Complementary to Often Used Benchmarks Based on Atomization Energies and Should Guide Chemists in Their Search for Accurate and Efficient Computational Thermochemistry Methods.},

Abstract = {in This Paper We Assess the Accuracy of the B3LYP, X3LYP, and Newly Developed M06-L, M06-2X, and M06 Functionals to Predict the Binding Energies of Neutral and Charged Water Clusters Including (H2O)N, N = 2−8, 20), H3O+(H2O)N, N = 1−6, and OH−(H2O)N, N = 1−6. We Also Compare the Predicted Energies of Two Ion Hydration and Neutralization Reactions on the Basis of the Calculated Binding Energies. In All Cases, We Use as Benchmarks Calculated Binding Energies of Water Clusters Extrapolated to the Complete Basis Set Limit of the Second-Order M{\O}ller−Plesset Perturbation Theory With the Effects of Higher Order Correlation Estimated at the Coupled-Cluster Theory With Single, Double, and Perturbative Triple Excitations in the Aug-Cc-pVDZ Basis Set. We Rank the Accuracy of the Functionals on the Basis of the Mean Unsigned Error (MUE) Between Calculated Benchmark and Density Functional Theory Energies. The Corresponding MUE (Kcal/Mol) for Each Functional Is Listed in Parentheses. We Find That M06-L (0.73) and M06 (0.84) Give the Most Accurate Binding Energies Using Very Extended Basis Sets Such as Aug-Cc-pV5Z. For More Affordable Basis Sets, the Best Methods for Predicting the Binding Energies of Water Clusters Are M06-L/Aug-Cc-pVTZ (1.24), B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) (1.29), and M06/Aug-Cc-PVTZ (1.33). M06-L/Aug-Cc-pVTZ Also Gives More Accurate Energies for the Neutralization Reactions (1.38), Whereas B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) Gives More Accurate Energies for the Ion Hydration Reactions (1.69).},

Abstract = {Gaussian Basis Sets of Quadruple Zeta Valence Quality for Rb-Rn Are Presented, as Well as Bases of Split Valence and Triple Zeta Valence Quality for H-Rn. The Latter Were Obtained by (Partly) Modifying Bases Developed Previously. A Large Set of More Than 300 Molecules Representing (Nearly) All Elements-Except Lanthanides-In Their Common Oxidation States Was Used to Assess the Quality of the Bases All Across the Periodic Table. Quantities Investigated Were Atomization Energies, Dipole Moments and Structure Parameters for Hartree-Fock, Density Functional Theory and Correlated Methods, for Which We Had Chosen Moller-Plesset Perturbation Theory as an Example. Finally Recommendations Are Given Which Type of Basis Set Is Used Best for a Certain Level of Theory and a Desired Quality of Results.},

Abstract = {Reference Quality Conformational Energies Have Been Obtained for the 52 Unique Conformers of Melatonin by Means of Explicitly Correlated Ab Initio Methods as Well as the ccCA Composite Method. These Data Have Then Been Used to Evaluate More Approximate Methods, Including a Variety of Density Functionals Both on Their Own and Paired With Various Empirical Dispersion Corrections. Owing to the Presence of Internal Contacts of the C-H{\Textperiodcentered}{\Textperiodcentered}{\Textperiodcentered}O and C-H{\Textperiodcentered}{\Textperiodcentered}{\Textperiodcentered}N Variety, Basis Set Convergence Is Much Slower Than for Alkane Conformers, for Example, and Basis Sets of Aug-Cc-pVQZ or def2-QZVP Quality Seem to Be Required to Obtain Firm Estimates of the Basis Set Limit. Not Just HF, but Also Many DFT Functionals, Will Transpose the Two Lowest Conformers Unless Empirical Dispersion Corrections Are Added. Somewhat Surprisingly, Many DFT Functionals Reproduce the Reference Data to Fairly High Accuracy When Combined With the D3BJ Empirical Dispersion Correction or the "Nonlocal" Vydrov-Van Voorhis Dispersion Model. The Two Best Performers Including Dispersion Corrections Are the Double Hybrids DSD-PBEP86-D3BJ and B2GP-PLYP-D; If No Such Correction Is Permitted, Then M06-2X Puts in the Best Performance. Of Lower-Cost Ab Initio-Like Models, MP2.5 Yields the Best Performance, Followed by SCS-MP2.},

This Is Functionally Equivalent to the Pansini-Varandas Extrapolation for Large L. This Naturally Leads to a Simple Way to Extend These Extrapolations to N=7 and Higher. The Formula Is Validated by Comparison With Newly Optimized Extrapolation Factors for the AV{6,7}Z Basis Set Pairs and Literature Values for {6,7}ZaPa. For L\geq5, the CCSD Extrapolations of Both the Schwenke and Varandas Type Are Functionally Equivalent to E(L)=E_\Infty+a.(L-0.30)^{-3}, i.e., E(\Infty)=E(L)+[E(L)-E(L-1)]/([(L-0.30)/(L-1.30)]^3-1)},

@article{jmlm314,
abstract = {Double-hybrid density functional theory (DHDFT) offers a pathway to accuracies approaching composite wavefunction approaches like G4 theory. However, the GLPT2 (G{\"o}rling 2nd order perturbation theory) term causes them to partially inherit the slow $\propto L^{-3}$ (with $L$ the maximum angular momentum) basis set convergence of correlated wavefunction methods. This could potentially be remedied by introducing F12 explicit correlation: we investigate the basis set convergence of both DHDFT and DHDFT-F12 for the large and chemically diverse GMTKN55 (general main-group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions) benchmark suite. The B2GP-PLYP-D3(BJ) and revDSD-PBEP86-D4 double hybrid density functionals (DHDFs) are investigated as test cases, together with orbital basis sets as large as aug-cc-pV5Z and F12 basis sets as large as cc-pV(Q+d)Z-F12. We show that F12 greatly accelerates basis set convergence of DHDFs, to the point that even the modest cc-pVDZ-F12 basis set is closer to the basis set limit than cc-pV(Q+d)Z or def2-QZVPP in orbital-based approaches, and in fact comparable in quality to cc-pV(5+d)Z. Somewhat surprisingly, aug-cc-pVDZ-F12 is not required even for the anionic subsets. In conclusion, DHDF-F12/VDZ-F12 eliminates concerns about basis set convergence in both the development and application of double-hybrid functionals. Mass storage and I/O bottlenecks for larger systems can be circumvented by localized pair natural orbital approximations, which also exhibit much gentler system size scaling.},

@article{Rendell1990,
abstract = {The harmonic vibrational frequencies of the Be3 and Be 4 clusters have been determined using ab initio electronic structure calculations. Large atomic natural orbital (ANO) basis sets have been used in conjunction with high levels of correlation treatment. These include multireference configuration-interaction (MRCI) and singles and doubles coupled-cluster (CCSD) methods, and the CCSD method augmented with a correction for connected triple excitations [CCSD(T)]. In general, all three treatments agree very well. The only substantial disagreement is for the totally symmetric stretching mode in Be3, where the CCSD method yields a harmonic frequency that is 57 cm-1 smaller than the MRCI value. The fundamental vibrational frequencies of Be3 and Be4 have been determined using second-order perturbation theory to obtain anharmonic corrections; Be3 is treated as a symmetric top and Be4 as a spherical top. Full CCSD(T) quartic force fields were used to determine anharmonic constants, vibration-rotation interaction constants, and quartic and sextic centrifugal distortion constants. The anharmonic corrections for the two vibrational modes of Be3 reduce the frequencies by less than 5\%, which is typical for bond-stretching vibrations. The a1 and e vibrations of Be4 exhibit somewhat smaller anharmonic corrections that decrease the frequency by about 3\%. However, the only IR active mode of Be4 [$\omega$3(t2)] displays a large positive anharmonic correction of + 111 cm-1, or almost 20\%. Finally, IR intensities have been determined using the double harmonic approximation. {\textcopyright} 1990 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We present a new computational method with associated computer program TROVE (Theoretical ROVibrational Energies) to perform variational calculations of rovibrational energies for general polyatomic molecules of arbitrary structure in isolated electronic states. The (approximate) nuclear kinetic energy operator is represented as an expansion in terms of internal coordinates. The main feature of the computational scheme is a numerical construction of the kinetic energy operator, which is an integral part of the computation process. Thus the scheme is self-contained, i.e., it requires no analytical pre-derivation of the kinetic energy operator. It is also general, since it can be used in connection with any internal coordinates. The method represents an extension of our model for pyramidal XY3 molecules reported previously [S.N. Yurchenko, M. Carvajal, P. Jensen, H. Lin, J.J. Zheng, W. Thiel, Mol. Phys. 103 (2005) 359]. Non-rigid molecules are treated in the Hougen-Bunker-Johns approach [J.T. Hougen, P.R. Bunker, J.W.C. Johns, J. Mol. Spectrosc. 34 (1970) 136]. In this case, the variational calculations employ a numerical finite basis representation for the large-amplitude motion using basis functions that are generated by Numerov-Cooley integration of the appropriate one-dimensional Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

T. Hougen, P. R. Bunker, and J. W. C. Johns [J. Mol. Spectrosc.34, 136-172 (1970)]. The Hamiltonian is expanded as a power series in the variables $\rho${variant}j = 1 - exp(-aj$\Delta$rj2), where the aj are molecular constants obtained from the potential energy function. The eigenvalues of this Hamiltonian are obtained variationally, i.e., through direct matrix diagonalization without the use of perturbation theory. As vibrational basis functions we use numerically integrated bending functions obtained as described by P. Jensen [Comp. Phys. Rep.1, 1-55 (1983)] combined with Morse oscillator stretching functions [V. {\v{S}}pirko, P. Jensen, P. R. Bunker, and A. {\v{C}}ejchan, J. Mol. Spectrosc.112, 183-202 (1985)]. On the basis of a published ab initio potential energy surface for the methylene radical CH2 [A. D. McLean, P. R. Bunker, R. Escribano, and P. Jensen, J. Chem.

Since in the present work we use Morse oscillator and rigid bender basis functions to describe the internal dynamics of the triatomic molecule, we name the new approach by the acronym MORBID. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {A recently proposed new family of density functionals S. Grimme, J. Chem. Phys. 124, 34108 2006 adds a fraction of nonlocal correlation as a new ingredient to density functional theory DFT. This fractional correlation energy is calculated at the level of second-order many-body perturbation theory PT2 and replaces some of the semilocal DFT correlation of standard hybrid DFT methods. The new “double hybrid” functionals termed, e.g., B2-PLYP contain only two empirical parameters that have been adjusted in thermochemical calculations on parts of the G2/3 benchmark set. The methods have provided the lowest errors ever obtained by any DFT method for the full G3 set of molecules. In this work, the applicability of the new functionals is extended to the exploration of potential energy surfaces with analytic gradients. The theory of the analytic gradient largely follows the standard theory of PT2 gradients with some additional subtleties due to the presence of the exchange-correlation terms in the self-consistent field operator. An implementation is reported for closed-shell as well as spin-unrestricted reference determinants. Furthermore, the implementation includes external point charge fields and also accommodates continuum solvation models at the level of the conductor like screening model. The density fitting resolution of the identity RI approximation can be applied to the evaluation of the PT2 part with large gains in computational efficiency. For systems with 500–600 basis functions the evaluation of the double hybrid gradient is approximately four times more expensive than the calculation of the standard hybrid DFT gradient. Extensive test calculations are provided for main group elements and transition metal containing species. The results reveal that the B2-PLYP functional provides excellent molecular geometries that are superior compared to those from standard DFT and MP2},

abstract = {We report three modifications to recent ab initio, full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) for the water dimer [X. Huang, J. Chem. Phys. 128, 034312 (2008)]. The first modification is a refit of ab initio electronic energies to produce an accurate dissociation energy De. The second modification adds replacing the water monomer component of the PES with a spectroscopically accurate one and the third modification produces a hybrid potential that goes smoothly in the asymptotic region to the flexible, Thole-type model potential, version 3 dimer potential (denoted TTM3-F) [G. S. Fanourgakis and S. S. Xantheas, J. Chem. Phys. 128, 074506 (2008)]. The rigorous D0 for these PESs, obtained using diffusion Monte Carlo calculations of the dimer zero-point energy, and an accurate zero-point energy of the monomer, range from 12.5 to 13.2 kJ/mol (2.99-3.15 kcal/mol), with the latter being the suggested benchmark value. For TTM3-F D0 equals 16.1 kJ/mol. Vibrational calculations of monomer fundamental energies using the code MULTIMODE are reported for these PESs and the TTM3-F PES and compared to experiment. A classical molecular dynamics simulation of the infrared spectra of the water dimer and deuterated water dimer at 300 K are also reported using the ab initio dipole moment surface reported previously [X.

abstract = {We present a new numerical integrator for molecular integrals that generates automatically an adaptive molecular grid. The tolerance of the numerical integration is the only input parameter of the integrator besides the atomic coordinates and the atomic numbers. The adaptive numerical integrator was successfully implemented in our new density-functional theory method (DFT method) ALLCHEM using the self consistent field (SCF) procedure. The accuracy of the numerical integration is superior to pruned fixed grids for a given number of grid points. The adaptive grid generator allows a very efficient optimization of the grid for an individual molecular system. It is shown that the grid accuracy increases monotonically, if the given tolerance of the numerical integration is decreased. In this way it is possible to obtain results of high numerical precision. For a given tolerance of the numerical integration the adaptive grid generator automatically adjusts the grid to the basis set and the molecular structure. This feature increases the reliability of the numerical integration considerably and the number of expensive reference grid calculations can be reduced. The time for the grid generation is small compared to the total computation time for a SCF calculation. {\textcopyright} 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {The accurate determination of equilibrium structures for isolated molecules plays a central role in the evaluation and interpretation of stereoelectronic, thermodynamic, and spectroscopic properties. For small semi-rigid systems, state-of-the-art quantum-chemical computations can rival the most sophisticated experimental results. For larger molecules, cheaper yet accurate approaches need to be defined. The double-hybrid rev-DSD-PBEP86 functional already delivers remarkable results that can be further improved by means of a "Lego brick"model. This is based on the idea that a molecular system can be seen as formed by different fragments (the "Lego bricks"), whose accurate semi-experimental (SE) equilibrium geometries are available. The template molecule (TM) approach can be used to account for the modifications occurring when going from the isolated fragment to the molecular system under investigation, with the linear regression (LR) model employed to correct the linkage between the different fragments. The resulting TM-SE_LR approach has been tested with respect to available SE equilibrium structures and rotational constants. Indeed, the latter parameters straightforwardly depend on the equilibrium geometry of the system under consideration. The main outcome of our study is the reliability, robustness, and accuracy of this novel approach. The molecular systems considered for benchmarking the TM-SE_LR scheme are those formally issued from addition/elimination reactions of nucleophilic unsaturated radicals (e.g., CN, C2H, and phenyl) to alkenes, imines, and aldehydes, whose rotational spectra have been investigated, but accurate structural determinations are not yet available.},

abstract = {Vibrational spectroscopy represents an active frontier for the identification and characterization of molecular species in the context of astrochemistry and astrobiology. As new missions will provide more data over broader ranges and at higher resolution, especially in the infrared region, which could be complemented with new spectrometers in the future, support from laboratory experiments and theory is crucial. In particular, computational spectroscopy is playing an increasing role in deepening our understanding of the origin and nature of the observed bands in extreme conditions characterizing the interstellar medium or some planetary atmospheres, not easily reproducible on Earth. In this connection, the best compromise between reliability, feasibility and ease of interpretation is still a matter of concern due to the interplay of several factors in determining the final spectral outcome, with larger molecular systems and non-covalent complexes further exacerbating the dichotomy between accuracy and computational cost. In this context, second-order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) together with density functional theory (DFT) has become particularly appealing. The well-known problem of the reliability of exchange-correlation functionals, coupled with the treatment of resonances in VPT2, represents a challenge for the determination of standardized or “black-box” protocols, despite successful examples in the literature. With the aim of getting a clear picture of the achievable accuracy and reliability of DFT-based VPT2 calculations, a multi-step study will be carried out here. Beyond the definition of the functional, the impact of the basis set and the influence of the resonance treatment in VPT2 will be analyzed. For a better understanding of the computational aspects and the results, a short summary of vibrational perturbation theory and the overall treatment of resonances for both energies and intensities will be given. The first part of the benchmark will focus on small molecules, for which very accurate experimental and theoretical data are available, to investigate electronic structure calculation methods. Beyond the reliability of energies, widely used for such systems, the issue of intensities will also be investigated in detail. The best performing electronic structure methods will then be used to treat larger molecular systems, with more complex topologies and resonance patterns.},

@article{Barone2021,
abstract = {The principal aim of this book is to "bridge the gaps" between traditional quantum chemistry, which is mainly concerned with the calculation of the electronic properties of molecules, theoretical high resolution spectroscopy, traditionally concerned with the calculation of bound rovibronic states, and molecular dynamics which looks at the time dependence of molecular processes. The book is aimed at research workers in all of these fields, and in the border areas between them. The foreword by Dennis Salahub introduces the reader to the 20 chapters that make up this volume. Editing a book is like a research project. One is eager and enthusiastic at the beginning after one has first developed the idea, one is then often miserable and on the verge of giving up in the middle of the work as unforseen difficulties present themselves, and finally one is happy and relieved when it is completed. During the middle phase one needs constant advice and encouragement. To produce this book we sometimes needed it very much, and thus it is a real pleasure to acknowledge the help given us by Katya Vines of Wiley in this regard. We thank Marion Litz of the Bergische Universit{\"{a}}t in Wuppertal, Germany, for help with practical matters. It is also necessary to acknowledge the forebearance of the many authors who produced their chapters clearly written in a timely fashion, and then did not complain because of the delays caused by the few who did not. During the time we worked to produce this book PRB was the holder of an Alexander von Humboldt Senior Award at the Bergische Universit{\"{a}}t, and he is very grateful for that. Also PJ appreciates the hospitality he received from the Steacie Institute for Molecular Sciences at the National Research Council of Canada in Ottawa. The new Director General of the Steacie Institute for Molecular Sciences, Dennis Salahub, agreed to write a foreword that introduces the chapters, and we thank him for doing such a good job.},
