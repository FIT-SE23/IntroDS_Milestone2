abstract = "Many stochastic planning problems can be represented using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). A difficulty with using these MDP representations is that the common algorithms for solving them run in time polynomial in the size of the state space, where this size is extremely large for most real-world planning problems of interest. Recent AI research has addressed this problem by representing the MDP in a factored form. Factored MDPs, however, are not amenable to traditional solution methods that call for an explicit enumeration of the state space. One familiar way to solve MDP problems with very large state spaces is to form a reduced (or aggregated) MDP with the same properties as the original MDP by combining “equivalent” states. In this paper, we discuss applying this approach to solving factored MDP problems—we avoid enumerating the state space by describing large blocks of “equivalent” states in factored form, with the block descriptions being inferred directly from the original factored representation. The resulting reduced MDP may have exponentially fewer states than the original factored MDP, and can then be solved using traditional methods. The reduced MDP found depends on the notion of equivalence between states used in the aggregation. The notion of equivalence chosen will be fundamental in designing and analyzing algorithms for reducing MDPs. Optimally, these algorithms will be able to find the smallest possible reduced MDP for any given input MDP and notion of equivalence (i.e., find the “minimal model” for the input MDP). Unfortunately, the classic notion of state equivalence from non-deterministic finite state machines generalized to MDPs does not prove useful. We present here a notion of equivalence that is based upon the notion of bisimulation from the literature on concurrent processes. Our generalization of bisimulation to stochastic processes yields a non-trivial notion of state equivalence that guarantees the optimal policy for the reduced model immediately induces a corresponding optimal policy for the original model. With this notion of state equivalence, we design and analyze an algorithm that minimizes arbitrary factored MDPs and compare this method analytically to previous algorithms for solving factored MDPs. We show that previous approaches implicitly derive equivalence relations that we define here."

abstract="We consider a Reinforcement Learning setup without any (esp. MDP) assumptions on the environment. State aggregation and more generally feature reinforcement learning is concerned with mapping histories/raw-states to reduced/aggregated states. The idea behind both is that the resulting reduced process (approximately) forms a small stationary finite-state MDP, which can then be efficiently solved or learnt. We considerably generalize existing aggregation results by showing that even if the reduced process is not an MDP, the (q-)value functions and (optimal) policies of an associated MDP with same state-space size solve the original problem, as long as the solution can approximately be represented as a function of the reduced states. This implies an upper bound on the required state space size that holds uniformly for all RL problems. It may also explain why RL algorithms designed for MDPs sometimes perform well beyond MDPs.",

abstract = "An algorithmic framework that identifies irrelevant data (i.e., data that may be ignored without any loss of optimality) at agents of a sequential team is presented. This framework relies on capturing the properties of a sequential team that do not depend on the specifics of state spaces, the probability law, the system dynamics, or the cost functions. To capture these properties the notion of a team form is developed. A team form is then modeled as a directed acyclic graph and irrelevant data is identified using D-separation properties of specific subsets of nodes in the graph. This framework provides an algorithmic procedure for identifying and ignoring irrelevant data at agents, and thereby simplifying the form of control laws that need to be implemented."

A unified study of such integral probability metrics is given. We characterize the maximal class of functions that generates such a metric. Further, we show how some interesting properties of these probability metrics arise directly from conditions on the generating class of functions. The results are illustrated by several examples, including the Kolmogorov metric, the Dudley metric and the stop-loss metric.},

abstract = {A novel memory-based approach to dynamic programming that addresses the issue of generalization is presented. In this approach action values are represented by storing actual experiences in a memory and computed by a kind of locally weighted regression, and generalizations are made by searching the memory for relevant experience. The new approach does not require the quantization of continuous state or action spaces and can achieve arbitrarily variable resolution. By concentrating on important areas of the state space while ignoring the rest, the method represents an attempt to dodge Bellman's curse of dimensionality. This memory-based dynamic programming method has been implemented on a parallel machine, the Connection Machine, and used to successfully model and control a cart-pole system.}

  abstract = 	 {In this work we aim to solve a large collection of tasks using a single reinforcement learning agent with a single set of parameters. A key challenge is to handle the increased amount of data and extended training time. We have developed a new distributed agent IMPALA (Importance Weighted Actor-Learner Architecture) that not only uses resources more efficiently in single-machine training but also scales to thousands of machines without sacrificing data efficiency or resource utilisation. We achieve stable learning at high throughput by combining decoupled acting and learning with a novel off-policy correction method called V-trace. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IMPALA for multi-task reinforcement learning on DMLab-30 (a set of 30 tasks from the DeepMind Lab environment (Beattie et al., 2016)) and Atari57 (all available Atari games in Arcade Learning Environment (Bellemare et al., 2013a)). Our results show that IMPALA is able to achieve better performance than previous agents with less data, and crucially exhibits positive transfer between tasks as a result of its multi-task approach.}

 abstract = {We provide a unifying framework linking two classes of statistics used in two-sample and independence testing: on the one hand, the energy distances and distance covariances from the statistics literature; on the other, maximum mean discrepancies (MMD), that is, distances between embeddings of distributions to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), as established in machine learning. In the case where the energy distance is computed with a semimetric of negative type, a positive definite kernel, termed distance kernel, may be defined such that the MMD corresponds exactly to the energy distance. Conversely, for any positive definite kernel, we can interpret the MMD as energy distance with respect to some negative-type semimetric. This equivalence readily extends to distance covariance using kernels on the product space. We determine the class of probability distributions for which the test statistics are consistent against all alternatives. Finally, we investigate the performance of the family of distance kernels in two-sample and independence tests: we show in particular that the energy distance most commonly employed in statistics is just one member of a parametric family of kernels, and that other choices from this family can yield more powerful tests.},
