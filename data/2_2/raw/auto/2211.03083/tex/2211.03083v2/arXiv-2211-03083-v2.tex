\begin{abstract}
The strange-metal phase of overdoped cuprate superconductors exhibits a linear in temperature
resistivity in the low temperature, however, the origin of this remarkable anomaly is still not
well understood. Here the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity in the strange-metal
phase of overdoped cuprate superconductors is investigated. The momentum dependence of the
transport scattering rate arising from the umklapp scattering between electrons by the exchange
of the spin excitations is derived and employed to calculate the resistivity by making use of
the Boltzmann equation. It is shown that the resistivity is mainly dominated by the antinodal
and nodal umklapp scattering. In particular, a very low temperature $T_{\rm scale}$ scales with
$\Delta^{2}_{p}$, where $\Delta_{p}$ is the minimum umklapp vector at the antinode. In the
low temperature above $T_{\rm scale}$, the resistivity is linear in temperature with the
temperature linear coefficient that decreases with the increase of doping, however, in the far
lower temperature below $T_{\rm scale}$, the resistivity is instead quadratic in temperature.
The theory also shows that the same spin excitation that acts like a bosonic glue to hold the
electron pairs together also mediates scattering of electrons in the strange-metal phase
responsible for the linear in temperature resistivity in the low temperature.

\section{Introduction}\label{Introduction}

The parent compound of cuprate superconductors is identified as a Mott insulator
\cite{Fujita12}, in which the absence of the electronic conduction is due to the strong
electron correlation. Superconductivity then emerges when charge carriers are doped into this
Mott insulator \cite{Bednorz86}, therefore the physical properties of cuprate superconductors
mainly depend on the extent of doping
\cite{Vishik18,Campuzano04,Damascelli03,Fink07,Keimer15,Hussey08,Timusk99,Kastner98}, and the
regimes have been classified into the underdoped, optimally doped, and overdoped, respectively.
At the temperature above the superconducting (SC) transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$, the
electron is in a normal-state. Although the same strong electron correlation that leads to
the Mott insulating state persists into the doped regime, the normal-state retains a metallic
character \cite{Bednorz86}.

In the underdoped regime, the normal-state is dominated by a pseudogap. This pseudogap state
is characterized by a substantial suppression of the density of the low-energy excitations
\cite{Vishik18,Campuzano04,Damascelli03,Fink07}. However, the resistivity in the pseudogap phase
is quadratic in temperature \cite{Keimer15,Hussey08,Timusk99,Kastner98,Ando04,Barisic13,Pelc20},
as would be expected from the standard Landau Fermi-liquid theory
\cite{Schrieffer64,Abrikosov88,Mahan81}. On the other hand, in the optimally doped and overdoped
regimes, the normal-state is characterized by a number of the anomalous low-temperature
properties \cite{Keimer15,Hussey08,Timusk99,Kastner98} in the sense that they do not fit in with
the standard Landau-Fermi liquid theory \cite{Schrieffer64,Abrikosov88,Mahan81}. This is why in
the optimally doped and overdoped regimes, the phase of cuprate superconductors above
$T_{\rm c}$ is so-called as {\it the strange-metal phase} \cite{Keimer15}. In particular, in the
early experimental measurements \cite{Allen89,Gurvitch87,Takagi92}, it was observed that the
variation of the resistivity near the optimal doping is linear with temperature \cite{Takagi92},
extending to low temperatures of a few kelvin and extrapolating to zero resistivity at zero
temperature. This remarkable behaviour of the linear temperature dependence of the resistivity
is in a striking contrast to the behaviour in conventional metals
\cite{Schrieffer64,Abrikosov88,Mahan81}, where the low-temperature resistivity follows one of
several simple power laws, and if the electron-electron scattering dominates, then the
resistivity decreases quadratically as the temperature decreases to zero. In the latter, this
low-temperature linear in temperature (T-linear) resistivity was detected experimentally in a
wide doping range of the overdoped regime
\cite{Martin90,Mandrus92,Ando01,Daou09,Cooper09,Legros19,Yuan22}. Moreover, the suppression
of superconductivity with a magnetic field reveals that the low-temperature T-linear
resistivity persists down essentially to the zero temperature limit \cite{Ayres21}. Recently,
the systematic experimental results in the heavily overdoped regime yielded the low-temperature
T-linear resistivity all the way up to the edge of the SC dome
\cite{Legros19,Yuan22,Ayres21,Grisso21}. After intensive investigations over more than three
decades, it has now become clear that the long-standing low-temperature T-linear resistivity
\cite{Allen89,Gurvitch87,Takagi92,Martin90,Mandrus92,Ando01,Daou09,Cooper09,Legros19,Yuan22,Ayres21,Grisso21}
is a generic feature in the strange-metal phase of overdoped cuprate superconductors. In this
case, a key question posed by these experimental observations is raised: is there a common
bosonic excitation that is responsible for pairing the electrons also dominantly scatters
electrons in the strange-metal phase responsible for the low-temperature T-linear resistivity?

Although the low-temperature T-linear resistivity in the strange-metal phase of overdoped
cuprate superconductors is well established by now
\cite{Allen89,Gurvitch87,Takagi92,Martin90,Mandrus92,Ando01,Daou09,Cooper09,Legros19,Yuan22,Ayres21,Grisso21},
its origin remains the subject of the active research and debate. Theoretically, several
scenarios have been proposed for the origin of the T-linear resistivity
\cite{Varma89,Varma16,Varma20,Damle97,Sachdev11,Zaanen04,Luca07,Haldane18,Zaanen19,Hartnoll22,Hussey03,Rice17,Lee21}.
In particular, in the marginal Fermi-liquid phenomenology \cite{Varma89,Varma16,Varma20}, a
single T-linear scattering rate is introduced responsible for the T-linear resistivity.
Moreover, it has been postulated that the T-linear behaviour can be attributed to the
strongly interacting critical state anchored at a quantum critical point
occurring at doping of about $0.20$ where a phase transition is tuned to zero temperature
\cite{Varma20,Damle97,Sachdev11}. With the close relation to the physics of the quantum
critical point, the T-linear resistivity has been interpreted in terms of the Planckian
dissipation \cite{Zaanen04,Luca07,Haldane18,Zaanen19,Hartnoll22}
in which the relaxation-time achieves a putative universal minimum value, irrespective of
the underlying mechanisms. On the other hand, it has been argued that the elastic umklapp
scattering processes that directly transfer momentum between the electron sea and the
underlying square lattice lead to the resistivity linear in temperature in the strange-metal
phase \cite{Hussey03,Rice17}. More specifically, it has been shown recently that the
resistance arises from the electron umklapp scattering by the exchange of a critical bosonic
mode \cite{Lee21}, where the resistivity is characterized by a highly anisotropic scattering
rate. This highly anisotropic scattering rate is T-linear near the umklapp points and becomes
quadratic in temperature as one moves away from the umklapp point, which therefore leads to a
T-linear resistivity in the low-temperature regime and quadratic in temperature resistivity
in the far lower temperature regime \cite{Lee21}. These studies
\cite{Hussey03,Rice17,Lee21} and many others \cite{Honerkamp01,Hartnoll12,Tabis21} therefore
indicate that the umklapp scattering dominates the momentum-relaxation mechanism of the
electrical transport. However, up to now, the origin of the low-temperature T-linear
resistivity has not been discussed starting from a microscopic theory, and no explicit
calculations of the doping dependence of the low-temperature T-linear resistivity has been made
so far. Superconductivity with the highest $T_{\rm c}$ emerges directly as an instability of
the strange-metal phase, and it thus has long been recognized that the understanding of the
essential physics of the strange-metal phase is crucial for the understanding of the mystery
of the unconventional superconductivity.

In the recent works within the framework of the kinetic-energy-driven superconductivity, we
have studied the low-energy electronic structure of cuprate superconductors both in the SC
phase \cite{Liu21,Cao21,Zeng22} at the temperature below $T_{\rm c}$ and strange-metal phase
\cite{Feng16} at the temperature above $T_{\rm c}$, where the electron normal self-energy in
the particle-hole channel and electron anomalous self-energy in the particle-particle channel
are generated by the coupling of the electrons with the spin excitations. In particular, the
electrons are renormalized by the electron normal self-energy, and then all the exotic features
of the low-energy electronic structure arise from this renormalization of the electrons
\cite{Liu21,Cao21,Zeng22,Feng16}. In this paper, we start from this low-energy electronic
structure in the strange-metal phase of overdoped cuprate superconductors \cite{Feng16} to
study the nature of the doping dependence of the low-temperature resistivity, where the momentum
dependence of the transport scattering rate arising from the umklapp scattering between
electrons by the exchange of the same spin excitations is derived and employed to calculate the
resistivity in terms of the Boltzmann equation. Our results show that the momentum dependence
of the transport scattering rate presents a similar behavior of the single-particle scattering
rate, and is largest at around the antinodes and smallest at around the tips of the Fermi arcs,
indicating that the resistivity is mainly dominated by the antinodal and nodal umklapp
scattering. In particular, a very low temperature $T_{\rm scale}$ scales with $\Delta^{2}_{p}$,
where $\Delta_{p}$ is the minimum umklapp vector at the antinode. In the region of the low
temperature ($T>T_{\rm scale}$), the transport scattering rate is T-linear with the T-linear
coefficient that decreases with the increase of doping, however, in the region of the far lower
temperature ($T<T_{\rm scale}$), the transport scattering rate is instead quadratic in
temperature (T-quadratic). This T-linear behaviour of the transport scattering rate in the low
temperature and the T-quadratic behaviour in the far lower temperature in turn generate
respectively the T-linear resistivity in the low temperature and the T-quadratic resistivity
in the far lower temperature. Our results therefore indicate that the same spin excitation that
is responsible for pairing the electrons also mediates the scattering of electrons in the
strange-metal phase responsible for the low-temperature T-linear resistivity.

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section \ref{Formalism}, we begin by a short
summary of the unconventional features of the low-energy electronic structure due to the
coupling of the electrons with the spin excitations, and then within the framework of the
Boltzmann transport theory, we formulate the essential aspects of the electron umklapp
scattering between a circular electron Fermi surface (EFS) and its umklapp partner by the
exchange of the same spin excitation for deriving the resistivity. In
Section \ref{electron-resistivity}, the Boltzmann equation is employed to study the doping
dependence of the low-temperature resistivity, where we show a tendency with the antinodal
umklapp scattering that tends to generate the T-linear resistivity, while the nodal umklapp
scattering tends to induce a deviation from the T-linear resistivity. Finally, we give a
summary and discussion in Section \ref{summary}. In the
Appendix \ref{electron-electron-collision}, we present the details of the derivation of the
electron-electron collision term in the Boltzmann equation. In the
Appendix \ref{reduced-kernel-function}, we present the details for the estimate of the energy
scale in the transport scattering rate at the umklapp point.

\section{Theory}\label{Formalism}

\subsection{$t$-$J$ model in the fermion-spin representation} \label{model-constraint}

The crystal structure of cuprate superconductors is characterized by the square-lattice
copper-oxide layers \cite{Fujita12,Bednorz86,Vishik18,Campuzano04,Damascelli03,Fink07}, which
are sometimes considered to contain all the essential physics
\cite{Anderson87,Yu92,Lee06,Edegger07,Spalek22}. Immediately after the discovery of
superconductivity in cuprate superconductors, it was suggested that the fundamental properties
of the doped copper-oxide layer are properly accounted by the square-lattice $t$-$J$ model
\cite{Anderson87},
\begin{eqnarray}\label{tJ-model}
H=-\sum_{ll'\sigma}t_{ll'}C^{\dagger}_{l\sigma}C_{l'\sigma}
+\mu\sum_{l\sigma}C^{\dagger}_{l\sigma}
C_{l\sigma}+J\sum_{\langle ll'\rangle}{\bf S}_{l}\cdot {\bf S}_{l'},~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
acting on the restricted Hilbert-space with no double electron occupancy
$\sum_{\sigma}C^{\dagger}_{l\sigma}C_{l\sigma}\le1$, where the operator $C^{\dagger}_{l\sigma}$
($C_{l\sigma}$) denotes the creation (annihilation) operator of an electron on site $l$ with
spin $\sigma$, ${\bf S}_{l}$ is the spin operator of the electron with its components
$S_{l}^{x}$, $S_{l}^{y}$, and $S_{l}^{z}$, and $\mu$ is the chemical potential. In this paper,
the hopping of the constrained electrons $t_{ll'}$ is restricted to the nearest-neighbor (NN)
sites with the hoping amplitude $t_{ll'}=t$ and next NN sites with the hoping amplitude
$t_{ll'}=-t'$. The summation $\langle ll'\rangle$ indicates a sum over the NN pairs, while the
summation $ll'$ is taken over all the NN and next NN pairs. Throughout this paper, we choose the
parameters as $t/J=2.5$ and $t'/t=0.3$ as in the previous discussions \cite{Feng16}. The
magnitude of $J$ and the lattice constant of the square lattice are the energy and length units,
respectively. However, when necessary to compare with the experimental data, we set $J=1000$ K.

The essence of the strongly correlated physics is reflected in the on-site local constraint of
no double occupancy \cite{Yu92,Lee06,Edegger07,Spalek22,Zhang93}. To avoid the double electron
occupancy, we employ the fermion-spin transformation for the parametrization of the constrained
electron operators $C_{l\uparrow}$ and $C_{l\downarrow}$ as \cite{Feng0494,Feng15},
\begin{eqnarray}\label{CSSFS}
C_{l\uparrow}=h^{\dagger}_{l\uparrow}S^{-}_{l},~~~~
C_{l\downarrow}=h^{\dagger}_{l\downarrow}S^{+}_{l},
\end{eqnarray}
respectively, where the spin operator $S_{l}$ keeps track of the spin degree of freedom of the
constrained electron, while the spinful fermion operator $h_{l\sigma}=e^{-i\Phi_{l\sigma}}h_{l}$
keeps track of the charge degree of freedom of the constrained electron together with some
effects of spin configuration rearrangements due to the presence of the doped hole itself
(charge carrier). The advantages of this fermion-spin approach (\ref{CSSFS}) can be summarized
as: (i) the on-site local constraint of no double occupancy is satisfied in actual analyses;
(ii) the charge carrier or spin {\it itself} is $U(1)$ gauge invariant \cite{Feng0494,Feng15},
and then the collective mode for the spin is real and can be interpreted as the spin excitation
responsible for the dynamical spin response, while the electron quasiparticle as a result of the
charge-spin recombination of a charge carrier and a localized spin is not affected by the
statistical $U(1)$ gauge fluctuation \cite{Feng0494,Feng15}, and is responsible for the
electronic-state properties. This is why the fermion-spin approach (\ref{CSSFS}) is an efficient
calculation scheme which can provide a good description of the anomalous properties of cuprate
superconductors \cite{Feng0494,Feng15}.

In this fermion-spin representation (\ref{CSSFS}), the original $t$-$J$ model (\ref{tJ-model})
can be rewritten explicitly as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{cssham}
H&=&\sum_{ll'\sigma}t_{ll'}(h^{\dagger}_{l'\uparrow}h_{l\uparrow}S^{+}_{l}S^{-}_{l'}+
h^{\dagger}_{l'\downarrow}h_{l\downarrow}S^{-}_{l}S^{+}_{l'})-\mu_{\rm h}\sum_{l\sigma}
h^{\dagger}_{l\sigma}h_{l\sigma}\nonumber\\
&+&J_{\rm eff}\sum_{\langle ll'\rangle}{\bf S}_{l}\cdot {\bf S}_{l'},
\end{eqnarray}
where $S^{-}_{l}=S^{\rm x}_{l}-iS^{\rm y}_{l}$ and $S^{+}_{l}=S^{\rm x}_{l}+iS^{\rm y}_{l}$
are the spin-lowering and spin-raising operators for the spin $S=1/2$, respectively,
$J_{{\rm eff}}=(1-\delta)^{2}J$,
$\delta=\langle h^{\dagger}_{l\sigma}h_{l\sigma}\rangle=\langle h^{\dagger}_{l}h_{l}\rangle$
is the charge-carrier doping concentration, and $\mu_{\rm h}$ is the charge-carrier chemical
potential. As a natural consequence, the kinetic-energy term in the $t$-$J$ model
(\ref{tJ-model}) has been transferred as the coupling between charge and spin degrees of
freedom of the constrained electron, which reflects a basic fact that even the kinetic energy
term in the $t$-$J$ model (\ref{tJ-model}) has the strong Coulombic contribution due to the
restriction of no double occupancy at an any given site, and therefore governs the
unconventional features of cuprate superconductors.

\subsection{Coupling of electrons to the strongly dispersive spin excitation}
\label{Effective-propagator}

Starting from the $t$-$J$ model (\ref{cssham}) in the fermion-spin representation, we
\cite{Feng15,Feng0306,Feng12,Feng15a} have developed the kinetic-energy-driven
superconductivity, where at low temperatures, the strong coupling between charge and spin
degrees of freedom of the constrained electron in the kinetic energy of the $t$-$J$ model
(\ref{cssham}) by the exchange of the strongly dispersive spin excitations generates the d-wave
charge-carrier pairing state in the particle-particle channel, then the d-wave electron pairs
originated from the d-wave charge-carrier pairs are due to the charge-spin recombination
\cite{Feng15a}, and the condensation of these d-wave electron pairs reveals the d-wave SC-state.
As in the case of other distinct mechanisms for the spin-fluctuation driven pairing
\cite{Scalapino86,Miyake86,Monthoux91,Monthoux07}, the kinetic-energy-driven SC mechanism is
purely electronic without phonon, since the bosonic glue is identified into an electron pairing
mechanism not involving the phonon, the external degree of freedom, but the internal spin degree
of freedom of the constrained electron, indicating that the strong electron correlation favors
superconductivity. Moreover, the kinetic-energy-driven electron pairing state is controlled by
both the electron pair gap and single-particle coherence, which leads to that the doping
dependence of $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits a dome-like shape with the underdoped and overdoped regimes
on each side of the optimal doping, where $T_{\rm c}$ reaches its maximum
\cite{Feng15,Feng0306,Feng12,Feng15a}. In the kinetic-energy-driven superconductivity, the
self-consistent equations \cite{Feng15a} that are satisfied by the single-particle diagonal and
off-diagonal propagators in the SC-state are obtained in terms of the Eliashberg formalism
\cite{Eliashberg60}, and when the SC gap parameter $\bar{\Delta}=0$, these self-consistent
equations in the SC-state are reduced in the strange-metal phase as \cite{Feng16},
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{self-energy-diagram.pdf}
\caption{The skeletal diagram for the electron normal self-energy for scattering electrons from
the strongly dispersive spin excitations. The solid-line represents the electron propagator $G$,
and the dashed-line depicts the spin propagator $D^{(0)}$, while $\square$ describes the bare
vertex function $\Lambda$. \label{self-energy-diagram}}
\end{figure}
\begin{eqnarray}
G({\bf k},\omega)=G^{(0)}({\bf k},\omega)+G^{(0)}({\bf k},\omega)\Sigma_{\rm ph}({\bf k},\omega)
G({\bf k},\omega), ~~~~\label{EDGF}
\end{eqnarray}
where $G^{(0)}({\bf k},\omega)$ is the single-particle (diagonal) propagator of the $t$-$J$ model
(\ref{tJ-model}) in the tight-binding approximation, and has been derived as
$G^{(0)-1}({\bf k},\omega)=\omega-\varepsilon_{\bf k}$. In this case, the single-particle
propagator $G({\bf k},\omega)$ in Eq. (\ref{EDGF}) can be expressed explicitly as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{EGF}
G({\bf k},\omega)={1\over \omega-\varepsilon_{\bf k}-\Sigma_{\rm ph}({\bf k},\omega)},
\end{eqnarray}
where $\varepsilon_{\bf k}=-4t\gamma_{\bf k}+4t'\gamma_{\bf k}'+\mu$ is the electron energy
dispersion in the tight-binding approximation, with
$\gamma_{\bf k}=({\rm cos}k_{x}+{\rm cos} k_{y})/2$ and
$\gamma_{\bf k}'={\rm cos}k_{x}{\rm cos}k_{y}$, while the electron normal self-energy
$\Sigma_{\rm ph}({\bf k},\omega)$ sketched in Fig. \ref{self-energy-diagram} has been derived
as \cite{Feng16},
%\begin{widetext}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{ESE}
\Sigma_{\rm ph}({\bf k},\omega) &=& -4\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}{{\rm d}\omega'\over 2\pi}
\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}{{\rm d}\omega''\over 2\pi}{n_{\rm B}(\omega'')+n_{\rm{F}}(\omega')
\over\omega''-\omega'+\omega}\nonumber\\
&\times& {t^{2}\over N}\sum_{\bf p} {\rm Im}G({\bf p}+{\bf k},\omega'){\rm Im}
P^{(0)}({\bf k},{\bf p},\omega''),~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
%\end{widetext}
where $N$ is the number of lattice sites, $n_{\rm B}(\omega)$ and $n_{\rm F}(\omega)$ are the
boson and fermion distribution functions, respectively,
${\rm Im}P^{(0)}({\bf k},{\bf p},\omega)$ is the imaginary part of
$P^{(0)}({\bf k},{\bf p},\omega)$, while $P^{(0)}({\bf k},{\bf p},\omega)$ is so-called as the
effective spin propagator, which describes the nature of the spin excitation, and can be
expressed as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{ESP-1}
P^{(0)}({\bf k},{\bf p},\omega)={1\over N}\sum_{\bf q}\Lambda^{2}_{{\bf p}+{\bf q}+{\bf k}}
\Pi({\bf p},{\bf q},\omega),
\end{eqnarray}
with the bare vertex function $\Lambda_{{\bf k}}=4\gamma_{\bf k}-4(t'/t)\gamma_{\bf k}'$ and
the spin bubble $\Pi({\bf p},{\bf q},\omega)$. This spin bubble $\Pi({\bf p},{\bf q},\omega)$
is a convolution of two spin propagators, and has been evaluated as \cite{Feng16},
\begin{eqnarray}\label{spin-bubble-1}
\Pi({\bf p},{\bf q},ip_{m})={1\over\beta}\sum_{iq_{m}}D^{(0)}({\bf q},iq_{m})
D^{(0)}({\bf q}+{\bf p},iq_{m}+ip_{m}),~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
where $p_{m}$ and $q_{m}$ are the bosonic Matsubara frequencies, while the spin propagator
$D^{(0)}({\bf k},\omega)$ in the mean-field (MF) level has been derived as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{SGF-1}
D^{(0)}({\bf k},\omega)={B_{\bf k}\over\omega^{2}-\omega^{2}_{\bf k}},
\end{eqnarray}
with the MF spin excitation energy dispersion $\omega_{\bf k}$ and the weight function of
the spin excitation spectrum $B_{\bf k}$ that are strongly dispersive, and have been given
in Ref. \onlinecite{Feng15}. Substituting the above MF spin propagator (\ref{SGF-1}) into
Eq. (\ref{spin-bubble-1}), the spin bubble $\Pi({\bf p},{\bf q},\omega)$ can be derived as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{spin-bubble}
\Pi({\bf p},{\bf q},\omega)=-{\bar{W}^{(1)}_{{\bf p}{\bf q}}\over\omega^{2}
-[\omega^{(1)}_{{\bf p}{\bf q}}]^{2}}+{\bar{W}^{(2)}_{{\bf p}{\bf q}}\over\omega^{2}
-[\omega^{(2)}_{{\bf p}{\bf q}}]^{2}},~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
and then the effective spin propagator $P^{(0)}({\bf k},{\bf p},\omega)$ in
Eq. (\ref{ESP-1}) is obtained directly from the above spin bubble (\ref{spin-bubble}), where
$\omega^{(1)}_{{\bf p}{\bf q}}=\omega_{{\bf q}+{\bf p}}
+\omega_{\bf q}$ and $\omega^{(2)}_{{\bf p}{\bf q}}=\omega_{{\bf q}+{\bf p}}-\omega_{\bf q}$,
and the weight functions of the effective spin excitation spectrum,
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{W}^{(1)}_{{\bf p}{\bf q}}&=&{B_{\bf q}B_{{\bf q}+{\bf p}}\over 2\omega_{\bf q}
\omega_{{\bf q}+{\bf p}}}\omega^{(1)}_{{\bf p}{\bf q}}[n_{\rm B}(\omega_{{\bf q}+{\bf p}})
+n_{\rm B}(\omega_{\bf q})+1], ~~~~~\\
\bar{W}^{(2)}_{{\bf p}{\bf q}}&=&{B_{\bf q}B_{{\bf q}+{\bf p}}\over 2\omega_{\bf q}
\omega_{{\bf q}+{\bf p}}}\omega^{(2)}_{{\bf p}{\bf q}}[n_{\rm B}(\omega_{{\bf q}+{\bf p}})
-n_{\rm B}(\omega_{\bf q})].
\end{eqnarray}

With the above effective spin propagator (\ref{ESP-1}), the electron normal self-energy
$\Sigma_{\rm ph}({\bf k},\omega)$ in Eq. (\ref{ESE}) has been obtained explicitly in Ref.
\onlinecite{Feng16}. In particular, it should be emphasized that all the order parameters and
chemical potential $\mu$ in the calculation of $\Sigma_{\rm ph}({\bf k},\omega)$ have been
determined by the self-consistent calculation \cite{Feng15,Feng0306,Feng12,Feng15a}. In this
sense, our calculation for $\Sigma_{\rm ph}({\bf k},\omega)$ is controllable without using
adjustable parameters. Moreover, the sharp peaks visible for low-temperature in
$\Sigma_{\rm ph}({\bf k},\omega)$ and $P^{(0)}({\bf k},{\bf p},\omega)$ are actually a
$\delta$-function, broadened by a small damping used in the numerical calculation for a
finite lattice. The calculation in this paper for $\Sigma_{\rm ph}({\bf k},\omega)$ and
$P^{(0)}({\bf k},{\bf p},\omega)$ is performed numerically on a $160\times 160$ lattice in
momentum space, with the infinitesimal $i0_{+}\rightarrow i\Gamma$ replaced by a small damping
$\Gamma=0.05J$.

\subsection{Electron Fermi surface}\label{Octet-model}

The single-particle spectrum function $A({\bf k},\omega)$ now can be obtained directly from
the above single-particle propagator ({\ref{EGF}}) as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{ESF}
A({\bf k},\omega)&=&-2{\rm Im}G({\bf k},\omega)={2\Gamma_{\bf k}(\omega)\over
[\omega-\bar{E}_{\bf k}(\omega)]^{2}+\Gamma^{2}_{\bf k}(\omega)},~~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
with the corresponding single-particle scattering rate $\Gamma_{\bf k}(\omega)$ and
renormalized band structure $\bar{E}_{\bf k}(\omega)$,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
\Gamma_{\bf k}(\omega)&=& |{\rm Im}\Sigma_{\rm ph}({\bf k},\omega)|, ~~~~~
\label{SPSR}\\
\bar{E}_{\bf k}(\omega)&=& \varepsilon_{\bf k}+{\rm Re}\Sigma_{\rm ph}({\bf k},\omega),~~~~~
\label{RBS}
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
where ${\rm Re}\Sigma_{\rm ph}({\bf k},\omega)$ and ${\rm Im}\Sigma_{\rm ph}({\bf k},\omega)$
are the real and imaginary parts of the electron normal self-energy
$\Sigma_{\rm ph}({\bf k},\omega)$, respectively.

\end{figure}

The shape of EFS has deep consequences for the low-energy electronic properties
\cite{Vishik18,Campuzano04,Damascelli03,Fink07,Keimer15}, and has been also central to
addressing electrical transport \cite{Hussey08,Timusk99,Kastner98}. In the previous studies
\cite{Feng16}, the topology of EFS in the strange-metal phase of cuprate superconductors has
been discussed in terms of the intensity map of the single-particle spectral function
(\ref{ESF}) at zero energy $\omega=0$, where it has been shown that (i) the EFS continuous
contour is determined by the poles of the single-particle propagator ({\ref{EGF}}) at zero
energy, i.e.,
$\varepsilon_{\bf k}+{\rm Re}\Sigma_{\rm ph}({\bf k},0)=\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}=0$, with the
renormalized electron energy dispersion
$\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}=Z_{\rm F}\varepsilon_{\bf k}$ and the quasiparticle coherent weight
$Z^{-1}_{\rm F}=1-{\rm Re}\Sigma_{\rm pho}({\bf k},0)\mid_{{\bf k}=[\pi,0]}$, where
$\Sigma_{\rm pho}({\bf k},\omega)$ is the antisymmetric part of the electron normal
self-energy $\Sigma_{\rm ph}({\bf k},\omega)$; (ii) however, a strong redistribution of the
spectral weights on EFS is induced by the highly anisotropic momentum dependence of the
single-particle scattering rate $\Gamma_{\bf k}(\omega)$. For a convenience in the following
discussions of the electrical transport, we plot (a) the EFS map and (b) the direct surface plot
of the single-particle spectral function $A({\bf k},\omega)$ for zero energy $\omega=0$ at
doping $\delta=0.18$ with temperature $T=0.002J$ in Fig. \ref{EFS-map}, where the Brillouin
zone (BZ) center has been shifted by [$\pi,\pi$], and AN, TFA, and ND indicate the antinode,
tip of the Fermi arc, and node, respectively. The most noteworthy in Fig. \ref{EFS-map} are
the following: (i) the spectral weight at around the antinodal region is suppressed strongly,
reflecting a basic fact that EFS at around the antinodal region can not be observed
experimentally \cite{Norman98,Shi08,Sassa11,Meng11,Comin14,Horio16,Loret18}; (ii) the spectral
weight at around the nodal region is suppressed modestly, leading to the formation of the
disconnected Fermi arcs \cite{Norman98,Shi08,Sassa11,Meng11,Comin14,Horio16,Loret18}, where the
Fermi arc increases its length as a function of doping \cite{Meng11}, and then it evolves into
a continuous contour in momentum space near the end of the SC dome; (iii) however, almost all
the spectral weight on the Fermi arcs is assembled at around the tips of the Fermi arcs
\cite{Norman98,Shi08,Sassa11,Meng11,Comin14,Horio16,Loret18}. In other words, the electrons at
around the tips of the Fermi arcs have the largest density of states, and then the low-energy
electronic properties are largely governed by these electrons at around the tips of the Fermi
arcs. In particular, it has been observed experimentally that these characteristic features
shown in Fig. \ref{EFS-map} in the zero energy case can persist into the case for a finite
binding-energy even in the optimally and overdoped regimes \cite{Chatterjee06,He14}.

\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{single-particle-scattering.pdf}
\caption{The single-particle scattering rate $\Gamma(\theta)$ as a function of Fermi angle
$\theta$ at $\delta=0.18$ with $T=0.05J$ for $\omega=0$.
\label{single-particle-scattering}}
\end{figure}
More importantly, the suppression of the spectral
weight at around the antinodal and nodal regions can affect the electrical transport in two
ways \cite{Timusk99}: through the reduction of the number of current-carrying states, and
secondly, through the reduction in the density of electron excitations at around the antinodal
and nodal regions.

In our previous discussions \cite{Feng16}, it has been shown that the origin of the spectral
redistribution to form the Fermi arcs can be attributed to the highly anisotropic momentum
dependence of the single-particle scattering rate $\Gamma(\theta)$, where $\Gamma(\theta)$ is
defined as $\Gamma(\theta)=\Gamma_{{\rm k}_{\rm F}(\theta)}(0)$, and $\theta$ is the Fermi
angle. To see this highly anisotropic $\Gamma(\theta)$ in momentum space more clearly, we plot
the angular dependence of $\Gamma(\theta)$ along EFS from the antinode to the node at
$\delta=0.18$ with $T=0.05J$ in Fig. \ref{single-particle-scattering}, where the actual minimum
of $\Gamma(\theta)$ does not appear at around the nodal region, but resides exactly at around
the tip of the Fermi arc. However, the maximal $\Gamma(\theta)$ appears at around the antinodal
region, and then $\Gamma(\theta)$ decreases when the Fermi angle is moved away from the
antinode. In particular, $\Gamma(\theta)$ at around the nodal region is smaller than that around
the antinodal region. This angular dependence of $\Gamma(\theta)$ therefore leads to the
spectral redistribution to form the Fermi arcs with almost all the spectral weight inhabited at
around the tips of the Fermi arcs.

With the help of the above single-particle spectrum function (\ref{ESF}), we have also studied
the renormalization of the electrons in the strange-metal phase of overdoped cuprate
superconductors \cite{Feng16}, including the EFS instability driven charge order together with
the related octet scattering model
\cite{Comin14,Chatterjee06,He14,Comin16,Yin21,Pan01,Fujita19}, the complicated line-shape in
the energy distribution curve \cite{Dessau91,Norman97,Campuzano99,Wei08,DMou17}, and the
kink in the quasiparticle dispersion \cite{Kaminski01,Zhou03,Anzai10,He13,Yang19,Dessau93},
and the obtained results are well consistent with the corresponding experimental observations.
In particular, it should be emphasized that the similar results
\cite{Eschrig00,Manske01,Eschrig02,Eschrig06} have been also obtained based on the
phenomenological spin-fermion approach \cite{Eschrig06,Monthoux91}, where the coupling of a spin
excitation to electron quasiparticles leads to the emergence of the spectral dip in the energy
distribution curve and the kink in the quasiparticle dispersion
\cite{Eschrig00,Manske01,Eschrig02,Eschrig06}. These results
\cite{Feng16,Eschrig00,Manske01,Eschrig02,Eschrig06}
therefore show that the same spin excitation that is responsible for pairing electrons also
dominantly scatters electrons in the strange-metal phase at the temperature above $T_{\rm c}$
responsible for the low-energy electronic structure.

\subsection{Boltzmann equation}\label{Boltzmann-theory}

Although the magnitude of the single-particle scattering rate $\Gamma(\theta)$ shown in
Fig. \ref{single-particle-scattering} at a given Fermi angle is different from that of the
corresponding transport scattering rate \cite{Varma20}, both the scattering rates may have a
similar behaviour of the angular dependence. In this sense, the result of the angular
dependence of $\Gamma(\theta)$ shown in Fig. \ref{single-particle-scattering} also indicates
that the important electron scattering responsible for the resistivity is mainly concentrated
at the antinodes and nodes. For the discussions of the anomalous transport properties, it
needs to determine how the momentum distribution relaxes in the vicinity of these antinodes
and nodes. However, in the strange-metal phase of overdoped cuprate superconductors, there are
no well-defined quasiparticle excitations \cite{Keimer15,Hussey08,Timusk99,Kastner98}. In this
case, the momentum distribution relaxes in the system can be discussed in terms of the
memory-matrix transport formalism \cite{Mahajan13,Hartnoll14,Patel14,Lucas15,Vieira20,Mandal21}
or by solving the Boltzmann equation with the input of the scattering processes
\cite{Abrikosov88,Mahan81}. The memory-matrix transport formalism
\cite{Mahajan13,Hartnoll14,Patel14,Lucas15,Vieira20,Mandal21} has a crucial advantage of not
relying on the existence of well-defined quasiparticle excitations. In particular, this
memory-matrix transport approach has been employed to study the electrical transport in the
strange-metal phase of different strongly correlated models
\cite{Mahajan13,Hartnoll14,Patel14,Lucas15,Vieira20,Mandal21}, and the obtained results are
consistent with the rather severe set by experiments. On the other hand, in the Boltzmann
transport theory \cite{Abrikosov88,Mahan81}, it is crucial to assume that either the
quasiparticle excitations are well-defined or that the effective interaction between electrons
via various bosonic modes can be treated within the Eliashberg approach \cite{Eliashberg60} as
shown by Prange and Kadanoff \cite{Prange64} for an electron-phonon system. In this paper, we
study the electrical transport in the strange-metal phase of overdoped cuprate superconductors
by solving the Boltzmann equation with the input of the scattering processes, since the
interaction between electrons by the exchange of the spin excitations in the framework of the
kinetic-energy-driven superconductivity \cite{Feng15,Feng0306,Feng12,Feng15a} is treated within
the Eliashberg approach \cite{Eliashberg60} as we have mentioned in subsection
\ref{Effective-propagator}. In the Boltzmann transport theory \cite{Abrikosov88,Mahan81}, the
essential behaviour of the electrons is depicted by the distribution function
$f({\bf r},{\bf k},t)$. In the following discussions, we focus on the dc conductivity in the
homogeneous system only, where the position and time dependence in the distribution function
are absent, and then the distribution function satisfies the following Boltzmann equation
\cite{Abrikosov88,Mahan81},
\begin{eqnarray}\label{Boltzmann-equation-1}
{\partial {\bf k}\over\partial t}\nabla_{\bf k}f({\bf k})
=\left ({df\over dt}\right )_{\rm collisions}
\end{eqnarray}
where the right-hand side is the time rate of change due to the electron-electron collision,
while the factor ${\partial {\bf k}/\partial t}$ is equivalent to an acceleration, which is
equal to the forces on the electrons as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{momentum-equation}
{\partial {\bf k}\over\partial t}=-e{\bf E},
\end{eqnarray}
with the charge $e$, where for a convenience in the following discussions, the magnetic
field has been dropped, i.e., ${\bf H}=0$, while only an electric field ${\bf E}$ is applied
to the system. In this case, we substitute Eq. (\ref{momentum-equation}) into
Eq. (\ref{Boltzmann-equation-1}), and rewrite the Boltzmann equation
(\ref{Boltzmann-equation-1}) as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{Boltzmann-equation-2}
e{\bf E}\cdot\nabla_{\bf k}f({\bf k})+\left ({df\over dt}\right )_{\rm collisions}=0.
\end{eqnarray}
Following the discussions in Refs. \onlinecite{Prange64} and \onlinecite{Lee21}, we now
introduce the linear perturbation from the equilibrium in terms of the distribution function
as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{distribution-function}
f({\bf k})&=&n_{\rm F}({\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}})-{d n_{\rm F}({\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}})
\over d{\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}}}\tilde{\Phi}({\bf k}),
\end{eqnarray}
where $\tilde{\Phi}({\bf k})$ has been interpreted as a local shift of the chemical potential
at a given patch of EFS \cite{Lee21,Prange64}, and satisfies an antisymmetric relation
$\tilde{\Phi}(-{\bf k})=-\tilde{\Phi}({\bf k})$. With the help of the above distribution function
(\ref{distribution-function}), the Boltzmann equation (\ref{Boltzmann-equation-2}) can be
linearized with the result that can be expressed explicitly as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{Boltzmann-equation-3}
e{\bf v}_{\bf k}\cdot{\bf E}{\partial n_{\rm F}({\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}})\over
\partial {\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}}}=-\left ({df\over dt}\right )_{\rm collisions}
=I_{\rm e-e},
\end{eqnarray}
where ${\bf v}_{\bf k}=\nabla_{\bf k}{\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}}$ is the electron velocity and
$I_{\rm e-e}$ is the electron-electron collision term.

\subsection{Electron umklapp scattering}\label{Umklapp-scattering}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{scatter-process.pdf}
\caption{(Color online) Illustration of the umklapp scattering process \cite{Lee21} in which an
electron on a circular electron Fermi surface (left) is scattered by its partner on the umklapp
electron Fermi surface (right), where the intensity map of the electron Fermi surface is the
same as shown in Fig. \ref{EFS-map}a, while the perfect circle (red) is the circle with the
radius ${\rm k}^{\rm TFA}_{\rm F}$, where ${\bf k}^{\rm TFA}_{\rm F}$ is the Fermi wave vector
of the tips of the Fermi arcs. An electron on the electron Fermi surface (left) parametrized by
the Fermi angle $\theta$ is scattered to a point parametrized by the Fermi angle $\theta'$ on
the umklapp electron Fermi surface (right) by the spin excitation carrying momentum
${\rm p}(\theta,\theta')$. The minimum umklapp vector is $\Delta_{p}$ at the antinode (the Fermi
angle $\theta=0$). This physical picture is repeated for the other three umklapp electron Fermi
surfaces that are closest to the original electron Fermi surface. \label{scatter-process}}
\end{figure}

For the evaluation of the electron-electron collision in the Boltzmann equation
(\ref{Boltzmann-equation-3}), the mechanism of the momentum relaxation needs to be introduced
\cite{Abrikosov88,Mahan81}. After intensive investigations over more than three decades,
although the mechanism of the momentum relaxation for the low-temperature T-linear resistivity
still remains controversial, the electron umklapp scattering is believed to be at the heart of
the striking behaviour of the electrical transport in the strange-metal phase of overdoped
cuprate superconductors \cite{Hussey03,Rice17,Lee21,Honerkamp01,Hartnoll12,Tabis21}. In this
paper, we adopt the electron umklapp scattering as the mechanism of the momentum relaxation,
and then study the electrical transport in the strange-metal phase of overdoped cuprate
superconductors. For a convenience in the following discussions, the schematic picture for the
electron umklapp scattering process \cite{Lee21} is illustrated in Fig. \ref{scatter-process},
where an electron on a circular EFS (left) is scattered by its partner on the umklapp EFS
(right). In Fig. \ref{scatter-process}, the intensity map of EFS is the same as shown in
Fig. \ref{EFS-map}a, while the perfect circle (red) is the circle with the radius
${\rm k}^{\rm TFA}_{\rm F}$, where ${\bf k}^{\rm TFA}_{\rm F}$ is the Fermi wave vector of the
tips of the Fermi arcs. This perfect circle EFS (red) connects all eight tips of the Fermi
arcs, and therefore shows that almost all the spectral weight of the electron excitation
spectrum is accommodated on this circle EFS. It should be emphasized that in the present case,
the umklapp scattering of electrons is mediated by the same spin excitations as in the case of
the electron scattering for the renormalization of the electrons in subsection
\ref{Effective-propagator}. To understand the umklapp scattering mechanism in the present case
more clearly, the skeletal diagram of this umklapp scattering mechanism in energy and momentum
space is drawn in Fig. \ref{Feynman-diagram}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{Feynman-diagram.pdf}
\caption{The skeletal diagram of the umklapp scattering process for scattering electrons
from the spin excitation. The solid-line represents the electron propagator $G$, and the
dashed-line depicts the spin propagator $D^{(0)}$, while $\square$ describes the bare
vertex function $\Lambda$. \label{Feynman-diagram}}
\end{figure}

In the recently pioneering work \cite{Lee21}, a model of the electrons scattered by a critical
bosonic mode with the umklapp scattering being the dominant momentum relaxation mechanism has
been studied, where the umklapp scattering process is described as an electron-electron
scattering via the exchange of the critical boson propagator, rather than the scattering between
electrons via the emission and absorption of bosons. Following their discussions \cite{Lee21},
the electron-electron collision $I_{\rm e-e}$ in Eq. (\ref{Boltzmann-equation-3}) originated
from the electron umklapp scattering shown in Fig. \ref{Feynman-diagram} can be evaluated as,
\begin{widetext}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{electron-collision-1}
I_{\rm e-e}&=&{1\over N^{2}}\sum_{{\bf k}',{\bf p}} {2\over T}
|P({\bf k},{\bf p},{\bf k}',\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}
-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}+{\bf p}+{\bf G}})|^{2}
\{\tilde{\Phi}({\bf k})+\tilde{\Phi}({\bf k'})
-\tilde{\Phi}({\bf k}+{\bf p}+{\bf G})-\tilde{\Phi}({\bf k}'-{\bf p})\}\nonumber\\
&\times&n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k})n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}'})
[1-n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}+{\bf p}+{\bf G}})]
[1-n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}'-{\bf p}})]
\delta(\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}+\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k'}
-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}+{\bf p}+{\bf G}}-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}'-{\bf p}}),
\end{eqnarray}
\end{widetext}
which therefore leads to the appearance of the electrical resistance \cite{Abrikosov88,Mahan81},
where ${\bf G}$ indicates a set of reciprocal lattice vectors, and the umklapp scattering
process in Eq. (\ref{electron-collision-1}) is described as an electron-electron scattering via
the exchange of the effective spin propagator $P({\bf k},{\bf p},{\bf k}',\omega)$, rather than
the scattering between electrons via the emission and absorption of the spin excitations, while
the effective spin propagator $P({\bf k},{\bf p},{\bf k}',\omega)$ is obtained directly from
Fig. \ref{Feynman-diagram} as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{ESP}
P({\bf k},{\bf p},{\bf k}',\omega)&=&{1\over N}\sum_{\bf q}\Lambda_{{\bf p}+{\bf q}+{\bf k}}
\Lambda_{{\bf q}+{\bf k}'}\Pi({\bf p},{\bf q},\omega).~~~
\end{eqnarray}
The reason of the electron-electron scattering via the exchange of the effective spin propagator
in the present case is the same as in the case discussed in Ref. \onlinecite{Lee21}. For the
normal scattering (${\bf G}=0$), the conservation of the total momentum in
Eq. (\ref{electron-collision-1}) is satisfied straightforwardly \cite{Lee21}, since the
distribution in the case of the normal scattering will rapidly equilibrate to a fermion
distribution function with a shifted overall momentum
$\tilde{\Phi}({\bf k})\propto {\bf k}\cdot{\bf E}$, which leads to that its contribution to the
integral of the electron-electron collision in Eq. (\ref{electron-collision-1}) is exactly zero.
However, if we consider the scattering between electrons via the emission and absorption of the
spin excitations, we would have to keep track of the extra shifted boson distribution function
as well, which introduces more complications \cite{Lee21}. Moreover, it has been shown that the
vanishing of the normal scattering in the electron-electron collision
(\ref{electron-collision-1}) is more general \cite{Lee21}. This is following a basic fact that
in order to stay on EFS and conserve the total momentum and energy, the momentum of the normal
scattering partner ${\bf k}'$ must equal to either ${\bf k}+{\bf p}$ or $-{\bf k}$. In the
former case, the last two terms in $\{...\}$ in Eq. (\ref{electron-collision-1}) cancel the
first two terms. However, in the latter case, since the antisymmetric relation
$\tilde{\Phi}(-{\bf k})=-\tilde{\Phi}({\bf k})$, the first two terms in $\{...\}$ in
Eq. (\ref{electron-collision-1}) cancel, while the same cancellation is valid for the last two
terms corresponding to the outgoing pair ${\bf k}+{\bf p}$ and ${\bf k}'-{\bf p}$. These
results therefore indicate that the contribution from the normal scattering to the integral of
the electron-electron collision (\ref{electron-collision-1}) is negligible \cite{Lee21}.

In the usual case \cite{Abrikosov88,Mahan81}, the derivation of the Boltzmann equation
starting from the nonequilibrium electron propagator involves integrating over energy $\omega$.
However, the electrons at the bottom of the band (then the deep inside EFS) can not be
thermally excited, and as a matter of the principle, all the low-temperature conduction
processes in the strange-metals should involve only states at around EFS \cite{Haldane18}. In
particular, in the early discussions \cite{Prange64}, it has been realized to pick a patch of
EFS specified by $k(\theta)$ with the range $\theta\in [0,2\pi]$, which defines a contour along
EFS parametrized by the direction $\theta$ of the Fermi momentum vector and integrate the
perpendicular momentum and hence over
$\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}$ instead. This is a formula expressed entirely in terms of the EFS
property. Furthermore, this method has been employed to study the low-temperature T-linear
resistivity due to the umklapp scattering from a critical bosonic mode \cite{Lee21}. In the
present case of the umklapp scattering of electrons mediated by the spin excitation, an
electron on EFS parametrized by the Fermi angle $\theta$ is scattered to a point parametrized
by the Fermi angle $\theta'$ on the umklapp EFS by the spin excitation carrying momentum
${\rm p}(\theta,\theta')$ as shown in Fig. \ref{scatter-process}. In this case, the usual
distribution function $f({\bf k})$ can be replaced as $f[k(\theta)]$. However, in the usual
formulation, the vector ${\bf k}$ is decomposed into $k(\theta)$ and the momentum in the
perpendicular direction \cite{Lee21,Prange64}, which is then represented by
$\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}$. From this EFS parametrization, the standard Boltzmann equation
(\ref{Boltzmann-equation-3}) now can be expressed simply, where the component of the momentum
${\bf k}$ perpendicular to EFS is replaced by $\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}/v_{\bf k}$ and
$\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}$ in turn is replaced by $\omega$. After a straightforward
calculation [see Appendix \ref{electron-electron-collision}], the above electron-electron
collision $I_{\rm e-e}$ in Eq. (\ref{electron-collision-1}) can be derived explicitly,
and then the Boltzmann equation (\ref{Boltzmann-equation-3}) can be obtained as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{electron-collision}
e{\bf v}_{\rm F}(\theta)\cdot {\bf E}=-2\int {d\theta'\over {2\pi}}\zeta(\theta')
F(\theta,\theta')[\Phi(\theta)-\Phi(\theta')],~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Phi(\theta)$ is defined as $\tilde{\Phi}[{\rm k}(\theta)]$ and satisfies an
antisymmetric relation \cite{Lee21} $\Phi(\theta)=-\Phi(\theta+\pi)$, ${\bf v}_{\rm F}(\theta)$
is the Fermi velocity at the Fermi angle $\theta$, and
$\zeta(\theta')={\rm k}^{2}_{\rm F}/[4\pi^{2}{\rm v}^{3}_{\rm F}]$ is the density of states
factor at angle $\theta'$ with the Fermi wave vector ${\rm k}_{\rm F}$ and Fermi velocity
${\rm v}_{\rm F}$, while the coefficient of $\Phi(\theta)$ in the first term of the
right-hand side of Eq. (\ref{electron-collision}),
\begin{eqnarray}\label{scattering-rate}
\gamma(\theta)=2\int {d \theta' \over {2\pi}} \zeta(\theta')F(\theta,\theta'),
\end{eqnarray}
is defined as the scattering out rate \cite{Lee21} from the state of ${\rm k}(\theta)$, which
also is so-called as {\it the angular dependence of the transport scattering rate}, while the
kernel function $F(\theta,\theta')$ depends on the Fermi angles $\theta$ and $\theta'$ in
terms of the magnitude of the momentum transfer ${\rm p}(\theta,\theta')$, i.e.,
$F(\theta,\theta')$ connects the points $\theta$ and $\theta'$ on the umklapp EFS as shown in
Fig. \ref{scatter-process}, and is given by,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{kernel-function}
F(\theta,\theta')&=&{1\over T}\int {d\omega\over 2\pi}{\omega^{2}\over {\rm p}(\theta,\theta')}
{|\bar{P}[{\rm k}(\theta),{\rm p}(\theta,\theta'),\omega]|}^{2}\nonumber\\
&\times& n_{\rm B}(\omega)[1+n_{\rm B}(\omega)],~~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
where the reduced effective spin propagator
$\bar{P}[{\rm k}(\theta),{\rm p}(\theta,\theta'),\omega]$ has been given in Appendix
\ref{electron-electron-collision}. This kernel function $F(\theta,\theta')$ can be also called
as the probability weight or the strength of the umklapp scattering in which the electron at
the $\theta$ point of EFS is scattered by its umklapp partner at the $\theta'$ point of the
neighboring EFS.

%\section{Quantitative characteristics of electrical resistivity}\label{electron-resistivity}

\section{Low-temperature T-linear resistivity}\label{electron-resistivity}

The dc conductivity then is evaluated in a standard way by the momentum (then the Fermi angle
$\theta$) integral of the umklapp scattering process on EFS, where the current density is given
by \cite{Abrikosov88,Mahan81},
\begin{eqnarray}\label{current-density-1}
{\bf J}=-en_{0}{1\over N}\sum_{\bf k}{\bf v}_{\bf k}f({\bf k}),
\end{eqnarray}
with the relaxation of the momentum that is generated by the action of the electric field on
the mobile electrons \cite{Haldane18} at around EFS with the density $n_{0}$.
Substituting the distribution function $f({\bf k})$ in Eq. (\ref{distribution-function}) into
the above current density equation (\ref{current-density-1}) and performing the radial
integration, the current density now can be obtained as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{current-density}
{\bf J} &=& en_{0}{1\over N}\sum_{\bf k}{\bf v}_{\bf k}
{dn_{\rm F}({\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}})\over d\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}}\tilde{\Phi}({\bf k})
\nonumber\\
&=&-en_{0}{{\rm k}_{\rm F}\over {\rm v}_{\rm F}}\int {d\theta\over (2\pi)^{2}}
{\bf v}_{\rm F}(\theta)\Phi(\theta).~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}

For the calculation of the dc conductivity, we need to obtain the local shift of the chemical
potential $\Phi(\theta)$. The spectral weight of
${\rm Im}P({\bf k}_{\rm F},{\bf p}-{\bf k}_{\rm F},{\bf k'}_{\rm F},\omega)$ in
Eq. (\ref{electron-collision-1}) achieves its maximal value at around the antinodal region
[see Fig. \ref{effective-spin-propagator} in Appendix \ref{electron-electron-collision}],
where the scattering probability for two electrons is largest. In other words, the main
contribution to the kernel function $F(\theta,\theta')$ [then the resistivity] comes from
such umklapp scattering process in which the electron at around the antinodal region of the
circular EFS (left) shown in Fig. \ref{scatter-process} is scattered by its partner at around
the antinodal region of the umklapp circular EFS (right), where the Fermi angle $\theta'$ is
almost identical with the Fermi angle $\pi-\theta$, and then according to the antisymmetric
relation satisfied by $\Phi(\theta)$, the following relation,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{Phi-theta-1}
\Phi(\theta')=\Phi(\pi-\theta)=-\Phi(\theta),
\end{eqnarray}
is valid. In this relaxation-time approximation, the local shift of the chemical potential
$\Phi(\theta)$ can be derived straightforwardly from Eqs. (\ref{electron-collision})
and (\ref{scattering-rate}) as \cite{Lee21},
\begin{eqnarray}\label{Phi-theta}
\Phi(\theta)=-{e{\rm v}_{\rm F}{\rm cos}(\theta)E_{\hat{x}}\over 2\gamma(\theta)},
\end{eqnarray}
where the electric field ${\bf E}$ has been chosen along the $\hat{x}$-axis. Substituting the
above result of $\Phi(\theta)$ into Eq. (\ref{current-density}), the dc conductivity
therefore is obtained explicitly as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{dc-conductivity}
\sigma_{\rm dc}(T)={1\over 2}e^{2}n_{0}{\rm k}_{\rm F}{\rm v}_{\rm F}
\int {d\theta\over (2\pi)^{2}}{\rm cos}^{2}(\theta)
{1\over\gamma(\theta)},
\end{eqnarray}
and then the resistivity is obtained directly from the above dc conductivity as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{dc-resistivity}
\rho(T)={1\over \sigma_{\rm dc}(T)}.
\end{eqnarray}

Now we are ready to discuss the striking features of the electrical transport in the
strange-metal phase of overdoped cuprate superconductors. We have made a series of calculations
for the resistivity $\rho(T)$ in Eq. (\ref{dc-resistivity}) at different doping levels, and the
results of the resistivity $\rho(T)$ as a function of temperature at the doping concentrations
$\delta=0.15$ (black-line), $\delta=0.18$ (blue-line), and $\delta=0.24$ (red-line) are
plotted in Fig. \ref{resistivity-temperature}. Apparently, the experimental results of the
doping dependence of the low-temperature resistivity
\cite{Allen89,Gurvitch87,Takagi92,Martin90,Mandrus92,Ando01,Daou09,Cooper09,Legros19,Yuan22,Ayres21,Grisso21}
are qualitatively reproduced, where the highly unconventional features can be summarized as:
(i) the resistivity $\rho(T)$ as a function of temperature is a perfect straight line down to
the temperature $T\sim 0.015J=15$K; (ii) the low-temperature T-linear resistivity extends over
a wide doping range in the overdoped regime, where the T-linear coefficient $A_{1}$ (then the
strength of the T-linear resistivity) decreases with the increase of doping. To see this
doping dependence of the T-linear coefficient more clearly, we plot $A_{1}$ versus doping
$\delta$ in Fig. \ref{coefficient-doping}, where $A_{1}$ {\it increases} monotonically as the
doping concentration is reduced in the overdoped regime, this tendency of the doping dependence
is in qualitative agreement with the experimental observations on overdoped cuprate
superconductors \cite{Legros19,Ayres21}; (iii) however, the resistivity deviates from the pure
T-linearity at the far lower temperature region $T< 0.015J=15$K, while our numerical fit
indicates that in this far lower temperature region $T< 0.015J=15$K, the resistivity decreases
quadratically as the temperature decreases. The results in Fig. \ref{resistivity-temperature}
therefore also indicate that the same spin excitation that acts like a bosonic glue to hold the
electron pairs together responsible for superconductivity \cite{Feng15,Feng0306,Feng12,Feng15a}
also dominates the electron scattering responsible for the low-temperature T-linear resistivity
in the strange-metal phase.

Finally, it should be emphasized that the local shift of the chemical potential $\Phi(\theta)$
can be also evaluated directly by the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation
(\ref{electron-collision}) together with an additional electron-impurity collision without
making the relaxation-time approximation \cite{Lee21}, where the Fermi angle $\theta'$ variable
in Eq. (\ref{electron-collision}) can be discretized, and then the integral-differential
equation (\ref{electron-collision}) is converted into the matrix equation. The accurate result
of $\Phi(\theta)$ is obtained in terms of the numerical calculation of the inverse of this
matrix. In this case, we have also performed a numerical calculation $\Phi(\theta)$ [then
$\rho(T)$], and the results show that although the resistivity saturates to a constant
$\rho_{0}(T)$ induced by the impurity, the qualitative behaviour of the electrical resistivity
is the same as that obtained in the above relaxation-time approximation except for the subtle
difference of the slopes, which is also qualitatively consistent with the results obtained
from electrons umklapp scattered by a critical bosonic mode \cite{Lee21}.

\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{out-rate-theta.pdf}
\caption{The transport scattering rate $\gamma(\theta)$ as a function of Fermi angle $\theta$
at $\delta=0.18$ with $T=0.05J$. \label{out-rate-theta}}
\end{figure}

From the dc conductivity in Eq. (\ref{dc-conductivity}) [then the resistivity in
Eq. (\ref{dc-resistivity})], it thus shows that the low-temperature T-linear resistivity in
the strange-metal phase of overdoped cuprate superconductors can be attributed to the
angle and temperature dependence of the transport scattering rate $\gamma(\theta,T)$ in
Eq. (\ref{scattering-rate}). To see this point more clearly, we first plot $\gamma(\theta)$ as a
function of Fermi angle $\theta$ at $\delta=0.18$ with $T=0.05J$ in Fig. \ref{out-rate-theta}.
In a comparison with the corresponding angular dependence of the single-particle scattering
rate $\Gamma(\theta)$ in Fig. \ref{single-particle-scattering}, it thus shows that although the
magnitude of $\gamma(\theta)$ at an any given Fermi angle is less than that of $\Gamma(\theta)$
at the corresponding Fermi angle, the global behaviour of the angular dependence of
$\gamma(\theta)$ is similar to that of $\Gamma(\theta)$, where $\gamma(\theta)$ is largest at
around the antinodal region, and smallest at around the tips of the Fermi arcs, which is also
consistent with the strong momentum dependence of the effective spin propagator
$P({\bf k},{\bf p}-{\bf k},{\bf k}',\omega)$ shown in Fig. \ref{effective-spin-propagator} in
Appendix \ref{electron-electron-collision}. In other words, both the transport scattering rate
$\gamma(\theta)$ and single-particle scattering rate $\Gamma(\theta)$ as a function of Fermi
angle presents the similar behavior of the effective spin propagator
$P({\bf k},{\bf p}-{\bf k},{\bf k}',\omega)$. The result in Fig. \ref{out-rate-theta} also
shows that the electrons at around the tips of the Fermi arcs are mainly responsible for the
conductivity, while the transport scattering rates at both the antinodal and nodal regions
mainly determine the magnitude of the electrical resistivity and of its behaviour of the
temperature dependence.

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.85]{out-rate-temperature.pdf}
\caption{The transport scattering rate $\gamma(T)$ at the antinode as a function of temperature
for $\delta=0.18$. \label{out-rate-temperature}}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, for an any given Fermi angle $\theta$, $\gamma(\theta,T)$ varies strongly
with temperature. To see this temperature dependence of $\gamma(\theta,T)$ more clearly, we
plot $\gamma(T)$ as a function of temperature for $\delta=0.18$ at the antinode in
Fig. \ref{out-rate-temperature}. It is surprising that $\gamma(T)$ is entirely T-linear in the
low-temperature region $T> 0.015J=15$K, where it decreases linearly with temperature as the
temperature decreases to $T\sim 0.015J=15$K, while this transport scattering rate $\gamma(T)$
is instead T-quadratic in the far lower temperature region
$T< 0.015J=15K$. Moreover, although $\gamma(\theta,T)$ is highly anisotropic in momentum-space,
this low-temperature T-linear $\gamma(\theta,T)$ occurs at an any given Fermi
angle $\theta$ (then for all directions), in agreement with the experimental observations
\cite{Grisso21}. In a comparison with the corresponding results of the temperature dependence
of the resistivity shown in Fig. \ref{resistivity-temperature}, we find that the
low-temperature T-linear behaviour of $\gamma(T)$ together with the low-temperature region and
the T-quadratic behaviour of $\gamma(T)$ together with the far lower temperature region are
respectively the same as the corresponding behaviours and regions in the resistivity $\rho(T)$,
which therefore shows that the remarkable T-linear resistivity in the low-temperature and the
T-quadratic resistivity in the far lower temperature are generated respectively by the
T-linear transport scattering rate in the low-temperature and T-quadratic transport scattering
rate in the far lower temperature.

$\delta=0.18$ with $T=0.05J$, where AN, TFA, and ND denote the antinode, tip of the Fermi arc,
and node, respectively. \label{kernel}}
\end{figure}

For a further understanding of the nature of the transport scattering rate $\gamma(\theta,T)$,
we discuss the temperature dependence of the kernel function (then the probability weight or
the strength of the electron umklapp scattering) $F(\theta,\theta')$ in
Eq. (\ref{kernel-function}), since the temperature dependence of $\gamma(\theta,T)$ in
Eq. (\ref{scattering-rate}) is mainly determined by the temperature dependence of
$F(\theta,\theta')$. In Fig. \ref{kernel}, we plot the surface plot of $F(\theta,\theta')$ at
$\delta=0.18$ with $T=0.05J$, where the probability weight of the electron umklapp scattering
has been separated clearly into three characteristic regions: (i) the antinodal region, where
a particularly large fraction of the probability weight is located, leading to that
$\gamma(\theta)$ is largest at around the antinodal region; (ii) the nodal region, where a
small amount of the probability weight is inhabited, leading to that the magnitude of
$\gamma(\theta)$ at around the nodal region is much smaller than that at around the antinodal
region; (iii) the region at around the tips of the Fermi arcs, where the strength of the
umklapp scattering is anomalously small, leading to the appearance of the weakest scattering at
around the tips of the Fermi arcs. The characteristic feature of the tips of the Fermi arcs is
that both the real and imaginary parts of the electron normal self-energy have the anomalously
small values \cite{Feng16}, indicating that the interaction (then the scattering) between
electrons at around the tips
of the Fermi arcs is particularly weak. In other words, although the electron density of states
is largest at around the tips of the Fermi arcs, the electron scattering at around the tips of
the Fermi arcs is quite weak, and then the electrons at around the tips of the Fermi arcs move
more freely than those at other parts of EFS. The above result in Fig. \ref{kernel} indicates
that the electron umklapp scattering is concentrated at around the antinodes and nodes, and
therefore is well consistent with the result of the angular dependence of $\gamma(\theta,T)$
shown in Fig. \ref{out-rate-theta}. However, the strengths of the antinodal and nodal umklapp
scattering are temperature dependent, which induces a competition between the antinodal and
nodal umklapp scattering, and can be well understood in terms of the ratio of the strength of
the nodal umklapp scattering to the strength of the antinodal umklapp scattering,
\begin{eqnarray*}
R_{\rm F}(T)={F(\theta_{\rm ND},\theta'_{\rm ND},T)\over F(\theta_{\rm AN},\theta'_{\rm AN},T)}.
\end{eqnarray*}
However, as we have mentioned in subsection \ref{Effective-propagator}, the calculation in this
paper is performed numerically on a $160\times 160$ lattice in momentum space, with the
infinitesimal $i0_{+}\rightarrow i\Gamma$ replaced by a small damping $\Gamma=0.05J$, which
leads to that the weight of the $\delta$-function type peak in $F(\theta,\theta')$ at the
antinode (node) spreads on the extremely small area $\{\theta_{\rm AN}\}$
$[\{\theta_{\rm ND}\}]$ around the antinode (node) as shown in Fig. \ref{kernel}. In particular,
the summation of these spread weights around this extremely small area $\{\theta_{\rm AN}\}$
$[\{\theta_{\rm ND}\}]$ is less affected by the calculation for a finite lattice. In this case,
a more appropriate ratio can be obtained as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{order-parameter}
\bar{R}_{\rm F}(T)={\bar{F}_{\rm ND}(T)\over \bar{F}_{\rm AN}(T)},
\end{eqnarray}
for the reduction of the size effect in the finite-lattice calculation, where
$\bar{F}_{\rm AN}(T)$ and $\bar{F}_{\rm ND}(T)$ are given by,
\begin{eqnarray*}
\bar{F}_{\rm AN}(T)&=&{1\over 2\pi}\sum_{\substack{\theta_{\rm AN}\in\{\theta_{\rm AN}\}\\
\theta'_{\rm AN}\in\{\theta'_{\rm AN}\}}}F(\theta,\theta',T),\\
\bar{F}_{\rm ND}(T)&=&{1\over 2\pi}\sum_{\substack{\theta_{\rm ND}\in\{\theta_{\rm ND}\}\\
\theta'_{\rm ND}\in\{\theta'_{\rm ND}\}}}F(\theta,\theta',T),
\end{eqnarray*}
with the summation $\theta_{\rm AN}\in\{\theta_{\rm AN}\}$
$[\theta'_{\rm AN}\in\{\theta'_{\rm AN}\}]$ that is restricted to the extremely small area
$\{\theta_{\rm AN}\}$ $[\{\theta_{\rm ND}\}]$ around the antinode (node). In this case, we have
carried out a series of calculations for the ratio $\bar{R}_{\rm F}(T)$ at different doping
levels, and the result of $\bar{R}_{\rm F}(T)$ as a function of temperature at $\delta=0.18$ is
plotted in Fig. \ref{R-ratio}, where $\bar{R}_{\rm F}(T)$ decreases monotonically with the
increase of temperature. In particular, in the lower ratio region ($\bar{R}_{\rm F}(T)< 0.445$),
which is corresponding to the low-temperature region ($T>0.015J=15$K), the strength of the nodal
umklapp scattering is rather weak, while the strength of the antinodal umklapp scattering is
quite strong. In comparison with the corresponding results of the transport scattering rate
$\gamma(T)$ in Fig. \ref{out-rate-temperature}, it thus shows a tendency, where the strong
antinodal umklapp scattering tends to generates the low-temperature T-linear behaviour of
$\gamma(T)$.
However, although both the strengths of the nodal and antinodal umklapp scattering decrease with
the decrease of temperature, the decrease of the strength of the nodal umklapp scattering is
slower than that of the antinodal umklapp scattering. In particular, in the higher ratio region
($\bar{R}_{\rm F}(T)> 0.445$), which is corresponding to the far lower temperature region
($T< 0.015J=15$K), although the strength of the antinodal umklapp scattering still is larger
than that of the nodal umklapp scattering, the strength of the nodal umklapp scattering becomes
strong enough. Moreover, in comparison with the corresponding results of the transport scattering
rate $\gamma(T)$ in Fig. \ref{out-rate-temperature}, it therefore shows a tendency, where the
strong enough nodal umklapp scattering in the far lower temperature tends to induce a deviation
from the T-linear behaviour of $\gamma(T)$.

antinodal umklapp scattering as a function of temperature for $\delta=0.18$. \label{R-ratio}}
\end{figure}

We now turn to show why the transport scattering rate $\gamma(T)$ [then the resistivity
$\rho(T)$] exhibits a crossover from the T-linear behaviour in the low-temperature into the
T-quadratic behaviour in the far lower temperature? The expression form of the kernel function
$F(\theta,\theta')$ in Eq. (\ref{kernel-function}) indicates that $F(\theta,\theta')$ is
proportional to the effective spin propagator $P({\bf k},{\bf p},{\bf k}',\omega)$. For a
convenience in the following discussions, the effective spin propagator
$P({\bf k},{\bf p},{\bf k}',\omega)$ in Eq. (\ref{ESP}) can be rewritten as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{reduced-propagator}
P({\bf k},{\bf p},{\bf k}',\omega)=-{1\over N}\sum\limits_{{\bf q},j}(-1)^{j+1}
{\varpi_{j}({\bf k},{\bf p},{\bf k}',{\bf q})\over\omega^{2}
-[\omega^{(j)}_{{\bf p}{\bf q}}]^{2}},
~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
with $j=1,2$, the weight functions $\varpi_{1}({\bf k},{\bf p},{\bf k}',{\bf q})$ and
$\varpi_{2}({\bf k},{\bf p},{\bf k}',{\bf q})$ that are given by,
\begin{subequations}
\begin{eqnarray}
\varpi_{1}({\bf k},{\bf p},{\bf k}',{\bf q})&=& \Lambda_{{\bf k}+{\bf p}+{\bf q}}
\Lambda_{{\bf q}+{\bf k}'}\bar{W}^{(1)}_{{\bf p}{\bf q}},\\
\varpi_{2}({\bf k},{\bf p},{\bf k}',{\bf q})&=& \Lambda_{{\bf k}+{\bf p}+{\bf q}}
\Lambda_{{\bf q}+{\bf k}'}\bar{W}^{(2)}_{{\bf p}{\bf q}}.
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
Substituting above result in Eq. (\ref{reduced-propagator}) into Eq. (\ref{kernel-function}),
the kernel function $F(\theta,\theta')$ can be rewritten as,
\begin{widetext}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{reduced-kernel-1}
F(\theta,\theta') &=& {1\over T}{1\over N^{2}}\sum\limits_{{\bf q},{\bf q}',jj'}(-1)^{j+j'}
P\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{d\omega\over 2\pi}{\omega^{2}\over p(\theta,\theta')}
{e^{\beta\omega}\over [e^{\beta\omega}-1]^{2}}{\varpi_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})\over\omega^{2}
-[\omega^{(j)}_{\theta\theta'}({\bf q})]^{2}}{\varpi_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')\over
\omega^{2}-[\omega^{(j')}_{\theta\theta'}({\bf q}')]^{2}}\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
&=& {1\over N^{2}}\sum\limits_{{\bf q},{\bf q}',jj'}(-1)^{j+j'}
{\varpi_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})\varpi_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')
\over 2\pi p(\theta,\theta')}{1\over T^{2}}
i2\pi I[C_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}),C_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')],~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
%\end{widetext}
with $\varpi_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})=\varpi_{j}
[k(\theta),p(\theta,\theta'),{\bf k}_{\rm F}',{\bf q}]$, $\varpi_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})
=\varpi_{j'}[k(\theta),p(\theta,\theta'),{\bf k}_{\rm F}',{\bf q}']$,
$\omega^{(j)}_{\theta\theta'}({\bf q})=\omega^{(j)}_{p(\theta,\theta'){\bf q}}$,
$\omega^{(j')}_{\theta\theta'}({\bf q}')=\omega^{(j')}_{p(\theta,\theta'){\bf q}'}$,
and the function,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{C-function-1}
I_{jj'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q},{\bf q}')=P\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{dx\over i2\pi}
{e^{x}\over (e^{x}-1)^{2}}{x^{2}\over [x^{2}-C^{2}_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})]
[x^{2}-C^{2}_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')]},~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
\end{widetext}
where $C_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})$ and $C_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')$ are defined as
$C_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})=\omega^{(j)}_{\theta\theta'}({\bf q})/T$ and
$C_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')=\omega^{(j')}_{\theta\theta'}({\bf q}')/T$, respectively.
From the MF spin propagator in Eq. (\ref{SGF-1}), the spin spectral function can be obtained
directly as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{spin-spectral-function}
A_{\rm spin}({\bf k})=\pi {B_{\bf k}\over\omega_{\bf k}}[\delta(\omega-\omega_{\bf k})
-\delta(\omega+\omega_{\bf k})],
\end{eqnarray}
where the MF spin excitation energy spectrum $\omega_{\bf k}$ is an even function
of momentum ${\bf k}$, and in particular, $\omega_{\bf k}|_{{\bf k}={\bf k}_{\rm A}}$ has an
extremely small value \cite{Feng15} [$\omega_{{\bf k}_{\rm A}}=0.00205J\approx 2$K at doping
$\delta=0.18$], where ${\bf k}_{\rm A}=[\pm\pi,\pm\pi]$ is the antiferromagnetic wave vector,
which therefore leads to that the spin excitations at around the ${\bf k}_{\rm A}$ point of BZ
have the largest density of states, and then the spin response is mainly governed by these
spin excitations at around the ${\bf k}_{\rm A}$ point. In this case, the effective spin
excitation energy dispersions $\omega^{(1)}_{{\bf p}{\bf q}}$ and $\omega^{(2)}_{{\bf p}{\bf q}}$
in Eq. (\ref{spin-bubble}) can be expanded, and then can be expressed approximately as,
\begin{subequations}\label{effective-spin-excitation}
\begin{eqnarray}
\omega^{(1)}_{{\bf p}{\bf q}}&=&\omega_{{\bf q}+{\bf p}}+\omega_{\bf q}\approx a({\bf q})p^{2}+
2\omega_{\bf q},\\
\omega^{(2)}_{{\bf p}{\bf q}}&=&\omega_{{\bf q}+{\bf p}}-\omega_{\bf q}\approx a({\bf q})p^{2},
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
where $a({\bf q})=(d^{2}\omega_{\bf q}/d^{2}{\bf q})$. The results in
Eq. (\ref{effective-spin-excitation}) therefore indicate that the effective spin propagator
$P({\bf k},{\bf p},{\bf k}',\omega)$ in Eq. (\ref{reduced-propagator}) is scaled by $p^{2}$.
However, due to this $p^{2}$ scaling in the effective spin propagator
(\ref{reduced-propagator}), the temperature scale when the electron umklapp scattering kicks
in can be very low \cite{Lee21}, being proportional to $\Delta^{2}_{p}$, where $\Delta_{p}$ is
the minimum umklapp vector at the antinode shown in Fig. \ref{scatter-process}. In other words,
$\bar{a}\Delta^{2}_{p}$ is referred to as the temperature scale, i.e.,
$T_{\rm scale}=\bar{a}\Delta^{2}_{p}$, where $\bar{a}=(1/N)\sum\limits_{\bf q}a({\bf q})$ is
the average value, and is a constant at a given doping. Moreover, this temperature scale is
obtained numerically as $T_{\rm scale}=\bar{a}\Delta^{2}_{p}=0.01513J\approx 15$K at doping
$\delta=0.18$, which is well consistent with the crossover temperature shown in
Fig. \ref{resistivity-temperature}. In this case, the function
$I_{jj'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q},{\bf q}')$ in the above equation (\ref{C-function-1}) can be
derived respectively in three different temperature regions:\\
(i) in the region for finite values of $C_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})$ and
$C_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')$, the function $I_{jj'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q},{\bf q}')$ in
Eq. (\ref{C-function-1}) can be evaluated [see Appendix \ref{reduced-kernel-function}] as,
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}\label{C-function-2}
I_{jj'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q},{\bf q}') = i{1\over 2[C^{2}_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})
-C^{2}_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')]}\left ( {C_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})
e^{C_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})}\over [e^{C_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})}-1]^{2}}
-{C_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')e^{C_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')}\over
[e^{C_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')}-1]^{2}}\right ).
\end{equation}
%\end{widetext}
In particular, in the low-temperature region, which is corresponding to the case of
$T>[T_{\rm scale}+\omega_{{\bf k}_{\rm A}}]$, the function
$I_{jj'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q},{\bf q}')$ in the above equation (\ref{C-function-2}) can be
reduced as $I_{jj'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q},{\bf q}')\sim -iT^{3}/[4(\bar{a}\Delta^{2}_{p})^{3}]$,
and then kernel function in Eq. (\ref{reduced-kernel-1}) in the low-temperature region is
obtained explicitly as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{reduced-kernel-3}
F(\theta,\theta') &\approx& {1\over N^{2}}\sum\limits_{{\bf q},{\bf q}',jj'}(-1)^{j+j'}
{\varpi_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})\varpi_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')\over
2p(\theta,\theta')}
{T\over \omega^{(j)}_{\theta\theta'}({\bf q})\omega^{(j')}_{\theta\theta'}({\bf q}')
[\omega^{(j)}_{\theta\theta'}({\bf q})+\omega^{(j')}_{\theta\theta'}({\bf q}')]}\propto T,
~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
which leads to the transport scattering rate $\gamma(T)\propto T$ [then the resistivity
$\rho(T)\propto T$] in the low temperature; \\
(ii) on the other hand, in the far lower temperature region, which is corresponding to the
case of $T<T_{\rm scale}$, the function $I_{jj'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q},{\bf q}')$ in
Eq. (\ref{C-function-1}) can be derived straightforwardly as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{C-function-4}
I_{jj'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q},{\bf q}') &= &-i{1\over 2\pi C^{2}_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})
C^{2}_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')}\int_{0}^{\infty}dx {e^{x}\over (e^{x}-1)^{2}}{x^{2}\over
[1-x^{2}/C^{2}_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})][1-x^{2}/C^{2}_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')]}
\nonumber\\
&=&-i{1\over 2\pi C^{2}_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})C^{2}_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')}
\int_{0}^{\infty}dx{e^{x}x^{2}\over (e^{x}-1)^{2}} \left [ 1+{x^{2}\over
C^{2}_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})}+\left ({x^{2}\over C^{2}_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})}
\right )^{2}+\cdots\right ]\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
\begin{eqnarray}
&\times& \left [ 1+{x^{2}\over C^{2}_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')}+\left ({x^{2}\over
C^{2}_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')}\right )^{2}+\cdots\right ]
\approx -i{1\over 2\pi
C^{2}_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})C^{2}_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')}
\int_{0}^{\infty}dx{e^{x}x^{2}\over (e^{x}-1)^{2}}\nonumber\\
&=& -i{1\over 6C^{2}_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})C^{2}_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')}
=-i{T^{4}\over 6[\bar{a}\Delta^{2}_{p}]^{2}[\bar{a}\Delta^{2}_{p}
+\omega_{{\bf k}_{\rm A}}]^{2}},~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
and then the kernel function in Eq. (\ref{reduced-kernel-1}) can be obtained in the far lower
temperature as,
\begin{eqnarray}
F(\theta,\theta') \approx {1\over N^{2}}\sum\limits_{{\bf q},{\bf q}',jj'}(-1)^{j+j'}
{\varpi_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})\varpi_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')\over
6p(\theta,\theta')}{1\over T^{2}}{T^{4}\over [\bar{a}\Delta^{2}_{p}]^{2}
[\bar{a}\Delta^{2}_{p}+\omega_{{\bf k}_{\rm A}}]^{2}}\propto T^{2},~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
\end{widetext}
which naturally gives rise to a T-quadratic behaviour of the transport scattering rate
$\gamma(T)\propto T^{2}$ [then the resistivity $\rho(T)\propto T^{2}$] in the far lower
temperature;\\
(iii) however, in the temperature region of
$T_{\rm scale}<T<T_{\rm scale}+\omega_{{\bf k}_{\rm A}}$, which is corresponding to the
transport scattering rate crossover region. In this extremely narrow crossover region (from
$\sim$15K to $\sim$ 17K), the resistivity is neither T-linear nor T-quadratic in temperature,
but is a nonlinear in temperature. The above results therefore explain why the resistivity has
a crossover from the T-linear behaviour in the low-temperature into the T-quadratic behaviour
in the far lower temperature. The above results also show that the umklapp scattering effect
via the exchange of the effective spin propagator is not exponentially small at the low
temperature as in the case of the electron-phonon coupling, but is power law down to the far
lower temperature as in the case of the coupling of the electrons with the critical bosonic
mode \cite{Lee21}.

\section{Summary and discussion}\label{summary}

Starting from the low-energy electronic structure of the strange-metal phase in overdoped
cuprate superconductors, we have studied the nature of the low-temperature electrical transport,
where the angular dependence of the transport scattering rate arising from the umklapp
scattering between electrons by the exchange of the effective spin propagator is derived and
employed to evaluate the resistivity by making use of the Boltzmann equation. Our results show
that although the magnitude of the transport scattering rate at an any given Fermi angle is
smaller than the corresponding value of the single-particle scattering rate, the transport
scattering rate presents the similar behavior of the single-particle scattering rate, where
the transport scattering rate is largest at around the antinodal region and smallest at around
the tips of the Fermi arcs, indicating that the resistivity is mainly dominated by the
antinodal and nodal umklapp scattering. In particular, a very low temperature $T_{\rm scale}$
scales with $\Delta^{2}_{p}$, this leads to that in the low-temperature, which is corresponding
to the case of $T>T_{\rm scale}$, the transport scattering rate is T-linear with the T-linear
coefficient that decreases with the increase of doping, however, in the far lower temperature,
which is corresponding to the case of $T<T_{\rm scale}$, the transport scattering rate is instead
T-quadratic. This T-linear behaviour of the transport scattering rate in the low temperature
and T-quadratic behaviour in the far lower temperature in turn induces respectively the T-linear
resistivity in the low temperature and T-quadratic resistivity in the far lower temperature.
Concomitantly, there is a tendency where the antinodal umklapp scattering tends to generate a
T-linear resistivity, while the nodal umklapp scattering tends to induce a deviation from the
T-linear resistivity. Our theory also shows that the same spin excitation that acts like a
bosonic glue to hold the electron pairs together responsible for the exceptionally high
$T_{\rm c}$ also mediates the electron scattering in the strange-metal phase of overdoped cuprate
superconductors responsible for the T-linear resistivity.

It should be emphasized that the effective spin propagator $P({\bf k},{\bf p},{\bf k}',\omega)$
in Eq. (\ref{ESP}) is obtained in the MF level \cite{Feng16,Feng15}, i.e.,
$P({\bf k},{\bf p},{\bf k}',\omega)$ in Eq. (\ref{ESP}) is obtained as a convolution of two MF
spin propagators in Eq. (\ref{SGF-1}). Thus this effective MF spin propagator mediated the
electron umklapp scattering in Eq. (\ref{electron-collision-1}) is better suited for the
discussions of the electrical transport in the strange-metal phase of overdoped cuprate
superconductors as in case of the phenomenologically critical bosonic mode mediated the electron
umklapp scattering \cite{Lee21}. This follows a basic fact that in the overdoped regime,
the effect of the magnetic fluctuation becomes quite weak
\cite{Fujita12,Timusk99,Kastner98,Eschrig06}, and then the electron scattering mediated by the
exchange of the effective MF spin propagator can give a suitable description of the
renormalization of the electrons \cite{Feng16,Liu21,Cao21,Zeng22} and the related electrical
transport discussed in this paper. However, in the underdoped regime, where the magnetic
fluctuation is particularly strong \cite{Fujita12,Timusk99,Kastner98,Eschrig06} and can be
described in terms of the full spin propagator \cite{Kuang15,Yuan01,Feng98}, where the spin
self-energy is derived in terms of the charge-carrier bubble, and then the electron scattering
should be mediated by the exchange of the effective full spin propagator for a suitable
discussion of the electrical transport in the underdoped cuprate superconductors. These and
the related issues are under investigation now. The transport scattering mechanism developed
in this paper for the understanding of the electrical transport in the strange-metal phase of
overdoped cuprate superconductors can be also employed to study the electrical transport in
other families of strange metals \cite{Bruin13,Grigera01} in the doped regime, where the
magnetic fluctuation is rather weak. In particular, based on this transport scattering theory,
we have also discussed the striking T-linear resistivity of the electron-doped cuprate
superconductors in the overdoped regime \cite{Ma22}, where we show the common mechanism linking
the electrical transport of both the hole- and electron-doped cuprate superconductors in the
overdoped regime. These and the related works will be presented elsewhere.

\section{Derivation of electron-electron collision}\label{electron-electron-collision}

The aim of this Appendix is to derive the electron-electron collision $I_{\rm e-e}$ in
Eq. (\ref{electron-collision}) of the main text. The electron-electron collision in
Eq. (\ref{electron-collision-1}) can be also rewritten as,
\begin{widetext}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{electron-collision-2}
I_{\rm e-e}&=&{1\over N^{2}}\sum_{{\bf k}',{\bf p}} {2\over T}|P({\bf k},{\bf p}
-{\bf k},{\bf k}',\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf p}+{\bf G}})|^{2}
[\tilde{\Phi}({\bf k})+\tilde{\Phi}({\bf k'})-\tilde{\Phi}({\bf p}+{\bf G})
-\tilde{\Phi}({\bf k}'+{\bf k}-{\bf p})] \nonumber\\
&\times& n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k})n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}'})
[1-n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf p}+{\bf G}})]
[1-n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}'+{\bf k}-{\bf p}})]
\delta(\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}+\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k'}
-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf p}+{\bf G}}-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}'+{\bf k}-{\bf p}}),~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
with the effective spin propagator $P({\bf k},{\bf p}-{\bf k},{\bf k}',\omega)$ that can be
expressed explicitly as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{ESP-2}
P({\bf k},{\bf p}-{\bf k},{\bf k}',\omega)={1\over N}\sum_{\bf q}\Lambda_{{\bf p}+{\bf q}}
\Lambda_{{\bf q}+{\bf k}'}\Pi({\bf p}-{\bf k},{\bf q},\omega)
=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}{d\omega'\over\pi}{{\rm Im}P({\bf k},{\bf p}-{\bf k},{\bf k}',\omega')
\over\omega'-\omega}, ~~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
\end{widetext}
where the imaginary part of the effective spin propagator
${\rm Im}P({\bf k},{\bf p}-{\bf k},{\bf k}',\omega)$ is directly related to the effective
spin spectral function, and is also defined as the scattering probability for two electrons.
\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{(Color online) The intensity map of the imaginary part of the effective spin propagator
${\rm Im}P({\bf k},{\bf p}-{\bf k},{\bf k}',\omega)$ along ${\bf k}={\bf k}'={\bf k}_{\rm F}$ in
a $[p_{x},p_{y}]$ plane at $\delta=0.18$ for energy $\omega=-0.05J$ with $T=0.002J$.
\label{effective-spin-propagator}}
\end{figure}
However, in our previous discussions \cite{Mou19}, we have shown that for given momentums
${\bf k}$ and ${\bf k}'$, ${\rm Im}P({\bf k},{\bf p}-{\bf k},{\bf k}',\omega)$ exhibits a
remarkable evolution with momentum ${\bf p}$ and $\omega$ except for $\omega=0$, where
${\rm Im}P({\bf k},{\bf p}-{\bf k},{\bf k}',0)=0$. To see this unusual momentum ${\bf p}$
dependence of ${\rm Im}P({\bf k},{\bf p}-{\bf k},{\bf k}',\omega)$ more clearly, we plot
the intensity map of ${\rm Im}P({\bf k},{\bf p}-{\bf k},{\bf k}',\omega)$ along EFS
${\bf k}={\bf k}'={\bf k}_{\rm F}$ in a $[p_{x},p_{y}]$ plane at $\delta=0.18$ for energy
$\omega=-0.05J$ with $T=0.002J$ in Fig. \ref{effective-spin-propagator}, where the spectral
weight of ${\rm Im}P({\bf k}_{\rm F},{\bf p}-{\bf k}_{\rm F},{\bf k'}_{\rm F},\omega)$ along
EFS ${\bf k}={\bf k}'={\bf k}_{\rm F}$ converges on the corresponding EFS
${\bf p}={\bf k}_{\bf F}$, i.e.,
${\rm Im}P({\bf k}_{\rm F},{\bf p}-{\bf k}_{\rm F},{\bf k'}_{\rm F},\omega)\neq 0$ for
${\bf p}={\bf k}_{\bf F} $, and otherwise
${\rm Im}P({\bf k}_{\rm F},{\bf p}-{\bf k}_{\rm F},{\bf k'}_{\rm F},\omega)=0$. In
particular, the spectral weight of
${\rm Im}P({\bf k}_{\rm F},{\bf p}-{\bf k}_{\rm F},{\bf k'}_{\rm F},\omega)$
exhibits the largest value at around the antinodal region, however, the most striking feature
is that the actual minimum of the spectral weight of
${\rm Im}P({\bf k}_{\rm F},{\bf p}-{\bf k}_{\rm F},{\bf k'}_{\rm F},\omega)$ does not appear
at around the node, but locates exactly at the tips of the Fermi arcs. This special angular
dependence of ${\rm Im}P({\bf k}_{\rm F},{\bf p}-{\bf k}_{\rm F},{\bf k'}_{\rm F},\omega)$
therefore induces an EFS reconstruction to form the Fermi arcs as shown in Fig. \ref{EFS-map}
with almost all the spectral weight of the electron excitation spectrum that resides at
around the tips of the Fermi arcs.

The result shown in Fig. \ref{effective-spin-propagator} therefore indicates that the main
contribution in $P({\bf k},{\bf p}-{\bf k},{\bf k'},\omega)$ comes from the part of the
momentum ${\bf p}={\bf k}$. In this case, the term
$\Phi({\bf k'})-\Phi({\bf k'}+{\bf k}-{\bf p})\sim 0$ in the right-hand side of
Eq. (\ref{electron-collision-2}), and then
$\delta(\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}+\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k'}-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf p}
+{\bf G}}-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}'+{\bf k}-{\bf p}})$ in the right-hand side of
Eq. (\ref{electron-collision-2}) can be replaced by the integral identity as \cite{Lee21},
\begin{widetext}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{identity}
\delta(\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}&+&\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k'}
-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf p}+{\bf G}}-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}'+{\bf k}-{\bf p}})
=\int^{\infty}_{-\infty}d\omega\delta(\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}
-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf p}+{\bf G}}-\omega)\delta(\omega+\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k'}
-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}'+{\bf k}-{\bf p}}).~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
\end{widetext}
On the other hand, the umklapp scattering process occurs mainly at around EFS, i.e.,
${\bf k'}\approx {\bf k'}_{\rm F}$, therefore the momentum ${\bf k'}$ in the effective spin
propagator $P({\bf k},{\bf p}-{\bf k},{\bf k}',\omega)$ can be approximately replaced by the
reduced effective spin propagator $\bar{P}({\bf k},{\bf p}-{\bf k},\omega)$,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{ESP-5}
\bar{P}({\bf k},{\bf p}-{\bf k},\omega)={1\over W_{\rm sp}}
P({\bf k},{\bf p}-{\bf k},{\bf k'}_{\rm F},\omega), ~~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
where following the common practice, the scattering probability for two electrons has been
normalized with the normalization factor $W^{2}_{\rm sp}=(1/N^{2})\sum_{{\bf k},{\bf p}}
\int |{\rm Im}\bar{P}({\bf k},{\bf p}-{\bf k},\omega)|^{2}d\omega$. Substituting above results
in Eqs. (\ref{identity}) and (\ref{ESP-5}) into Eq. (\ref{electron-collision-2}), the
electron-electron collision in Eq. (\ref{electron-collision-2}) can be expressed
explicitly as \cite{Lee21},
\begin{widetext}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{electron-collision-3}
I_{\rm e-e}&=&{1\over N^{2}}\sum_{{\bf k}',{\bf p}} {2\over T}|\bar{P}({\bf k},{\bf p}
-{\bf k},\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf p}+{\bf G}})|^{2}
[\tilde{\Phi}({\bf k})-\tilde{\Phi}({\bf p}+{\bf G})]n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k})
n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}'})[1-n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf p}+{\bf G}})]
[1-n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}'+{\bf k}-{\bf p}})]\nonumber\\
&\times& \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}d\omega\delta(\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}
-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf p}+{\bf G}}-\omega)
\delta(\omega+\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k'}-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}'+{\bf k}-{\bf p}})
\nonumber\\
&=&{1\over N^{2}}\sum_{{\bf k}',{\bf p}} {2\over T}|\bar{P}({\bf k},{\bf p},
\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf p}+{\bf k}+{\bf G}})|^{2}
[\tilde{\Phi}({\bf k})-\tilde{\Phi}({\bf p}+{\bf k}+{\bf G})]
n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k})
n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}'})
[1-n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf p}+{\bf k}+{\bf G}})]
[1-n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}'-{\bf p}})]\nonumber\\
&\times& \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}d\omega\delta(\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}
-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf p}+{\bf k}+{\bf G}}-\omega)
\delta(\omega+\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k'}-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}'-{\bf p}}).
\end{eqnarray}
\end{widetext}
Now we replace the momentum ${\bf k}'$ integration by an integration along EFS and one
perpendicular to it, i.e.,
$(1/N)\sum_{{\bf k}'}=\int {\rm k}'d{\rm k}'d\theta_{{\rm k}'}/(2\pi)^{2}$, where the
$\theta_{{\rm k}'}$ specifies a patch of EFS in the direction $\theta_{{\rm k}'}$ as shown in
Fig. \ref{scatter-process}, and then the radial integration $\int d{\rm k}'$ is replaced by an
integral over $\int d{\rm k}'=\int d\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf k}'}/{\rm v}_{\rm F}$. In this
case, the above electron-electron collision in Eq. (\ref{electron-collision-3}) can be
simplified as,
\begin{widetext}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{electron-collision-4}
I_{\rm e-e}&=&{1\over 2\pi}{2{\rm k}_{\rm F}\over T{\rm v}^{2}_{\rm F}}{1\over N}\sum_{{\bf p}}
{1\over |{\bf p}|}\int {d\omega\over 2\pi}|\bar{P}({\bf k},{\bf p},\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}
-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf p}+{\bf k}+{\bf G}})|^{2}[\tilde{\Phi}({\bf k})
-\tilde{\Phi}({\bf p}+{\bf k}+{\bf G})]n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k})
[1-n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf p}+{\bf k}+{\bf G}})]\nonumber\\
&\times& \omega[1+n_{\rm B}(\omega)]
\delta(\bar{\varepsilon}_{\bf k}-\bar{\varepsilon}_{{\bf p}+{\bf k}+{\bf G}}-\omega).
\end{eqnarray}
\end{widetext}
For the obtain of the above equation (\ref{electron-collision-4}), the following identity,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{identity-1}
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}d\varepsilon n_{\rm F}(\varepsilon-\omega)[1-n_{\rm F}(\varepsilon)]
=\omega[1+n_{\rm B}(\omega)],~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
has been used, where the appearance of the boson distribution function $n_{\rm B}(\omega)$ in
the right-hand side signals that we are describing a particle-hole effective
spin excitation which has the boson statistics \cite{Lee21}.

Now we turn to evaluate the momentum ${\bf p}$ integration, which is quite similar to the
evaluation of the momentum ${\bf k}'$ integration in Eqs. (\ref{electron-collision-3}) and
(\ref{electron-collision-4}). After a straightforward calculation for the momentum ${\bf p}$
integration in Eq. (\ref{electron-collision-4}), the electron-electron collision term can be
obtained explicitly as
\begin{widetext}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{electron-collision-5}
I_{\rm e-e}&=&{1\over (2\pi)^{2}}{2{\rm k}^{2}_{\rm F}\over T{\rm v}^{3}_{\rm F}}
\int {d\theta'\over 2\pi}\int {d\omega\over 2\pi}{1\over {\rm p}(\theta,\theta')}
|\bar{P}[k(\theta),p(\theta,\theta'),\omega]|^{2}[\Phi(\theta)-\Phi(\theta')]
n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{k(\theta)})
[1-n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{k(\theta)}-\omega)]\omega[1+n_{\rm B}(\omega)],~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
%\end{widetext}
where $\tilde{\Phi}({\bf k})$ and $\tilde{\Phi}({\bf p}+{\bf k}+{\bf G})$ in the right-hand
of side have been replaced by $\Phi(\theta)$ and $\Phi(\theta')$, respectively, and at
low-energy regime, the Boltzmann equation in Eq. (\ref{Boltzmann-equation-3}) can
be expressed as,
%\begin{widetext}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{Boltzmann-equation-4}
e{\bf v}_{\rm F}\cdot{\bf E}{\partial n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{k(\theta)})\over
\partial\bar{\varepsilon}_{k(\theta)}}&=&{1\over (2\pi)^{2}}{2{\rm k}^{2}_{\rm F}\over
T{\rm v}^{3}_{\rm F}}\int {d\theta'\over 2\pi}\int {d\omega\over 2\pi}
{1\over {\rm p}(\theta,\theta')}|\bar{P}[k(\theta),p(\theta,\theta'),\omega]|^{2}
[\Phi(\theta)-\Phi(\theta')]\nonumber\\
&\times& n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{k(\theta)})
[1-n_{\rm F}(\bar{\varepsilon}_{k(\theta)}-\omega)]\omega[1+n_{\rm B}(\omega)].~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
%\end{widetext}
Integrating both the left-hand and right-hand sides over the energy
$\bar{\varepsilon}_{k(\theta)}$, the Boltzmann equation in Eq. (\ref{Boltzmann-equation-4})
can be obtained explicitly as,
%\begin{widetext}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{Boltzmann-equation-5}
e{\bf v}_{\rm F}\cdot{\bf E}&=&-{1\over (2\pi)^{2}}{2{\rm k}^{2}_{\rm F}\over
T{\rm v}^{3}_{\rm F}}\int {d\theta'\over 2\pi}\int {d\omega\over 2\pi}
{1\over {\rm p}(\theta,\theta')}|\bar{P}[k(\theta),p(\theta,\theta'),\omega]|^{2}
[\Phi(\theta)-\Phi(\theta')]\omega^{2}n_{\rm B}(\omega)[1+n_{\rm B}(\omega)]\nonumber\\
&=&-2\int {d\theta'\over {2\pi}}\zeta(\theta')F(\theta,\theta')[\Phi(\theta)-\Phi(\theta')],
\end{eqnarray}
%\end{widetext}
which is the same as quoted in Eq. (\ref{electron-collision}) of the main text.

\section{Derivation of function $I_{jj'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q},{\bf q}')$}
\label{reduced-kernel-function}

In this Appendix, we sketch the derivation of the function
$I_{jj'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q},{\bf q}')$ in Eq. (\ref{C-function-1}) of the main text. For a
convenience in the following discussions, we define the functions:
$C=C_{j}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q})$, $C'=C_{j'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q}')$, and
$I(C,C')=I_{jj'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q},{\bf q}')$. In this case, the function
$I_{jj'}(\theta,\theta',{\bf q},{\bf q}')$ in Eq. (\ref{C-function-1}) of the main text can be
rewritten in the complex-plane as,
%\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}\label{C-function-5}
I_{z}(C,C')=\int{dz\over i2\pi}{e^{z}\over (e^{z}-1)^{2}}{z^{2}\over [z^{2}-C^{2}][z^{2}-C'^{2}]},
\end{equation}
with the closed integration path in the upper complex-plane, and then this integration along
the real axis can be obtained as,
\begin{widetext}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{C-function-6}
I(C,C')&=&P\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{dx\over i2\pi}{e^{x}\over (e^{x}-1)^{2}}{x^{2}\over
[x^{2}-C^{2}][x^{2}-C'^{2}]}= res[z=i\omega_{n}=i2\pi n(n\in N^{+})]\nonumber\\
&+&{1\over 2}\sum\limits_{z_{0}}\lim_{z\to z_{0}}(z-z_{0})
{e^{z}\over (e^{z} -1)^2}{z^{2}\over [z^{2}-C^{2}][z^2 - C'^{2}]},~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
where $z_{0}=i\omega_{n}$, $z_{0}=\pm C$, and $z_{0}=\pm C'$ are the poles. With the help of the
above results in Eq. (\ref{C-function-6}), the function $I(C,C')$ in Eq. (\ref{C-function-1})
can be expressed in terms of the residues of the corresponding poles as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{C-function-7}
I(C,C')&=&P\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}{dx\over i2\pi}
{e^{x}\over (e^{x}-1)^{2}}{x^{2}\over [x^{2}-C^{2}][x^{2}-C'^{2}]}
= -2\sum\limits_{n>0}{i\omega_{n}[i\omega_{n}^{4}-C^{2}C'^{2}]\over [i\omega_{n}^{2}
-C^{2}]^{2}[i\omega_{n}^{2}-C'^{2}]^{2}}\nonumber\\
&=&-\sum\limits_{n}{i|\omega_{n}|[i\omega_{n}^{4}-C^{2}C'^{2}]\over [i\omega_{n}^{2}
-C^{2}]^{2}[i\omega_{n}^{2}-C'^{2}]^{2}}.~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
For obtaining the above result in Eq. (\ref{C-function-7}), the following identities,
\begin{subequations}\label{residues-1}
\begin{eqnarray}
\lim_{z\to 0}z{e^{z}\over (e^{z} -1 )^{2}}{z^{2}\over [z^{2}-C^{2}][z^{2}- C'^{2}]} &=& 0,~~~~~ \\
\lim_{z\to \pm C}(z-\pm C){e^{z}\over (e^{z}-1)^{2}}{z^{2}\over [z^{2}-C^{2}][z^{2}-C'^{2}]}
&=& \pm {1\over 2}{e^{C}\over [e^{C}-1]^{2}}{C\over C^{2}-C'^{2}}, \\
\lim_{z\to \pm C'}(z-\pm C'){e^{z}\over (e^{z}-1)^{2}}{z^{2}\over [z^{2}-C^{2}][z^{2}-C'^{2}]}
&=& \pm {1\over 2}{e^{C'}\over [e^{C'}-1]^{2}}{C'\over C'^{2}-C^{2}},\\
res[z=i\omega_{n}=i2\pi n(n\in N^{+})]&=& -2{i\omega_{n}[i\omega_{n}^{4}-C^{2}C'^{2}]
\over [i\omega_{n}^{2}-C^{2}]^{2}[i\omega_{n}^{2}-C'^{2}]^{2}}, ~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
%\end{widetext}
have been used. We now introduce the following integration,
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{I}_{z}(C,C')=\int {dz\over i2\pi}{|z|[z^{4}-C^{2}C'^{2}]\over [z^{2}-C^{2}]^{2}
[z^{2}-C'^{2}]^{2}}n_{B}(z),
\end{eqnarray}
with the integration path along the closed path at infinity in the complex-plane, which
can be derived directly as,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{Cz-function-7}
\bar{I}_{z}(C,C')=\sum\limits_{n}{|\omega_n|[i\omega_{n}^{4}-C^{2}C'^{2}]\over [i\omega_{n}^{2}-
C^{2}]^{2}[i\omega_{n}^{2}-C'^{2}]^{2}}
+\sum\limits_{z_{0}}\lim_{z\to z_{0}}{d\over dz}(z-z_{0})^{2}{|z|[z^{4}-C^{2}C'^{2}]\over
[z^{2}-C^{2}]^{2}[z^{2}-C'^{2}]^{2}}n_{B}(z)=0,~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
where the poles are located at $z_{0}=\pm C$ and $z_{0}=\pm C'$, while the derivative in the
above equation (\ref{Cz-function-7}) can be calculated straightforwardly as,
%\begin{widetext}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{residues-5}
&&{d\over dz}(z-z_{0})^{2}{|z|[z^{4}-C^{2}C'^{2}]\over [z^{2}-C^{2}]^{2}[z^{2}-C'^{2}]^{2}}
n_{B}(z)|_{z\to z_{0}} = {d\over dz}{|z|[z^{4}-C^{2}C'^{2}]\over
[z+z_{0}]^{2}[z^{2}-z_{0}'^{2}]^{2}}n_{B}(z)|_{z\to z_{0}}\nonumber\\
&&={z_{0}^{2}(z_{0}^{2}-z_{0}'^{2})^{2}[|z_{0}|'(z_{0}^{4}-C^{2}C'^{2})+4|z_{0}|z_{0}^{3}]
-|z_{0}|z_{0}(z_{0}^{2}-z_{0}'^{2})(z_{0}^{4}-C^{2}C'^{2})(5z_{0}^{2}-z_{0}'^{2})\over
4z_{0}^{4}(z_{0}^{2}-z_{0}'^{2})^{4}}{1\over e^{{z}_{0}}-1}\nonumber\\
&&- {|z_{0}|(z_{0}^{4}-C^{2}C'^{2})\over 4z_{0}^{2}(z_{0}^{2}-z_{0}'^{2})^{2}}
{e^{z_{0}}\over (e^{z_{0}}-1)^{2}},~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
%\end{widetext}
and then the residues in Eq. (\ref{Cz-function-7}) corresponding to the poles at $z_{0}=\pm C$
and $z_{0}=\pm C'$ are derived explicitly as,
\begin{subequations}\label{residues-6}
\begin{eqnarray}
res(z_{0}=C) &=& res(z_{0}=-C) ={C\over 4(C^{2}-C'^{2})}{e^{C}\over (e^{C}-1)^{2}},\\
res(z_{0}=C')&=& res(z_{0}=-C')={C'\over 4(C'^{2}-C^{2})}{e^{C'}\over (e^{C'}-1)^{2}},~~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
respectively. We the help of the above results of the residues, the following identity is
obtained explicitly,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{residues-7}
-\sum\limits_{n}{|\omega_{n}|(i\omega_{n}^{4}-C^{2}C'^{2})\over (i\omega_{n}^{2}
-C^{2})^{2}(i\omega_{n}^{2}-C'^{2})^{2}}
= {1\over 2(C^{2}-C'^{2})}\left [ {Ce^{C}\over (e^{C}-1)^{2}}-{C'e^{C'}
\over (e^{C'}-1)^{2}} \right]. ~~~~~~
\end{eqnarray}
Substituting the above result in Eq. (\ref{residues-7}) into Eq. (\ref{C-function-6}), the
function $I(C,C')$ can be obtained explicitly as,
\begin{equation}
I(C,C')={i\over 2[C^{2}-C'^{2}]}\left ( {Ce^{C}\over [e^{C}-1]^{2}}-{C'e^{C'}\over
[e^{C'}-1]^{2}}\right ),
\end{equation}
which is the same as quoted in Eq. (\ref{C-function-2}) of the main text.
