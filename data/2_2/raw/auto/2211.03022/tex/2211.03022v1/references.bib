These data provide a benchmark for stringent tests of computational fluid dynamics models for complex systems where physical and chemical processes are intimately linked. The experiments measured krypton number densities in a sooting, atmospheric pressure, nonpremixed coflow flame that is widely used in combustion research. The experiments not only form targets for the models, but the simulations also identify potential sources of uncertainties in the measurements, allowing for future improvements. State-of-the-art x-ray fluorescence methods overcome issues in measuring gas temperatures that hinder traditional diagnostics.}}

abstract = {The need and prospect of incorporating realistic fuel chemistry in large-scale simulations of combustion phenomena and combustor performance are reviewed. The review first demonstrates the intricacies of chemical kinetics in homogeneous and diffusive systems, and emphasizes the essential importance of the comprehensiveness of chemical fidelity for mechanisms at the detailed and reduced levels. A systematic approach towards developing detailed reaction mechanisms is then outlined, followed by an extensive discussion on the development of reduced mechanisms and the associated strategies towards facilitated computation. Topics covered include skeletal reduction especially through directed relation graph; time-scale reduction based on the concepts of quasi-steady species enabled through computational singular perturbation; the lumping of isomers and of species with similar diffusivities; on-the-fly stiffness removal; the relative merits of implicit versus explicit solvers; and computation cost minimization achieved through tabulation and the judicious re-sequencing of the computational steps in arithmetic evaluations. Examples are given for laminar flames and direct numerical simulations of turbulent combustion to demonstrate the utility of the integrated strategy and the component methods in incorporating realistic chemistry of practical fuels in large-scale simulations, recognizing that the detailed mechanisms of these fuels may consist of hundreds to thousands of species and thousands to tens of thousands of reactions. Directions for further research are suggested.}

abstract = {While there is currently a lot of enthusiasm about “big data”, useful data is usually “small” and expensive to acquire. In this paper, we present a new paradigm of learning partial differential equations from small data. In particular, we introduce hidden physics models, which are essentially data-efficient learning machines capable of leveraging the underlying laws of physics, expressed by time dependent and nonlinear partial differential equations, to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments. The proposed methodology may be applied to the problem of learning, system identification, or data-driven discovery of partial differential equations. Our framework relies on Gaussian processes, a powerful tool for probabilistic inference over functions, that enables us to strike a balance between model complexity and data fitting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a variety of canonical problems, spanning a number of scientific domains, including the Navier–Stokes, Schrödinger, Kuramoto–Sivashinsky, and time dependent linear fractional equations. The methodology provides a promising new direction for harnessing the long-standing developments of classical methods in applied mathematics and mathematical physics to design learning machines with the ability to operate in complex domains without requiring large quantities of data.}

abstract = {Quantifying fluid flow is relevant to disciplines ranging from geophysics to medicine. Flow can be experimentally visualized using, for example, smoke or contrast agents, but extracting velocity and pressure fields from this information is tricky. Raissi et al. developed a machine-learning approach to tackle this problem. Their method exploits the knowledge of Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the dynamics of fluid flow in many scientifically relevant situations. The authors illustrate their approach using examples such as blood flow in an aneurysm. Science, this issue p. 1026 A machine learning approach exploiting the knowledge of Navier-Stokes equations can extract detailed fluid flow information. For centuries, flow visualization has been the art of making fluid motion visible in physical and biological systems. Although such flow patterns can be, in principle, described by the Navier-Stokes equations, extracting the velocity and pressure fields directly from the images is challenging. We addressed this problem by developing hidden fluid mechanics (HFM), a physics-informed deep-learning framework capable of encoding the Navier-Stokes equations into the neural networks while being agnostic to the geometry or the initial and boundary conditions. We demonstrate HFM for several physical and biomedical problems by extracting quantitative information for which direct measurements may not be possible. HFM is robust to low resolution and substantial noise in the observation data, which is important for potential applications.}}

abstract="Modeling of turbulent combustion system requires modeling the underlying chemistry and the turbulent flow. Solving both systems simultaneously is computationally prohibitive. Instead, given the difference in scales at which the two sub--systems evolve, the two sub--systems are typically (re)solved separately. Popular approaches such as the Flamelet Generated Manifolds (FGM) use a two--step strategy where the governing reaction kinetics are pre--computed and mapped to a low--dimensional manifold, characterized by a few reaction progress variables (model reduction) and the manifold is then ``looked--up'' during the run--time to estimate the high--dimensional system state by the flow system. While existing works have focused on these two steps independently, we show that joint learning of the progress variables and the look--up model, can yield more accurate results. We propose ChemTab an architecture that learns jointly and demonstrate its superiority.",
