   abstract = {Skew scattering on rare impurity configurations is shown to dominate the anomalous Hall effect in a 2D Rashba ferromagnet. The mechanism originates in scattering on rare impurity pairs separated by distances of the order of the Fermi wavelength. The corresponding theoretical description goes beyond the conventional noncrossing approximation. The mechanism provides the only contribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity in the most relevant metallic regime and strongly modifies previously obtained results for lower energies in the leading order with respect to impurity strength.},

   abstract = {The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) occurs in solids with broken time-reversal symmetry, typically in a ferromagnetic phase, as a consequence of spin-orbit coupling. Experimental and theoretical studies of the AHE are reviewed, focusing on recent developments that have provided a more complete framework for understanding this subtle phenomenon and have, in many instances, replaced controversy by clarity. Synergy between experimental and theoretical works, both playing a crucial role, has been at the heart of these advances. On the theoretical front, the adoption of the Berry-phase concepts has established a link between the AHE and the topological nature of the Hall currents. On the experimental front, new experimental studies of the AHE in transition metals, transition-metal oxides, spinels, pyrochlores, and metallic dilute magnetic semiconductors have established systematic trends. These two developments, in concert with first-principles electronic structure calculations, strongly favor the dominance of an intrinsic Berry-phase-related AHE mechanism in metallic ferromagnets with moderate conductivity. The intrinsic AHE can be expressed in terms of the Berry-phase curvatures and it is therefore an intrinsic quantum-mechanical property of a perfect crystal. An extrinsic mechanism, skew scattering from disorder, tends to dominate the AHE in highly conductive ferromagnets. The full modern semiclassical treatment of the AHE is reviewed which incorporates an anomalous contribution to wave-packet group velocity due to momentum-space Berry curvatures and correctly combines the roles of intrinsic and extrinsic (skew-scattering and side-jump) scattering-related mechanisms. In addition, more rigorous quantum-mechanical treatments based on the Kubo and Keldysh formalisms are reviewed, taking into account multiband effects, and demonstrate the equivalence of all three linear response theories in the metallic regime. Building on results from recent experiment and theory, a tentative global view of the AHE is proposed which summarizes the roles played by intrinsic and extrinsic contributions in the disorder strength versus temperature plane. Finally outstanding issues and avenues for future investigation are discussed. ©2010 The American Physical Society.},

For this reason disorder contributions to the AHE are difficult to treat systematically using a semiclassical Boltzmann equation approach, even when weak localization corrections are disregarded. In this article we explicitly demonstrate the equivalence of an appropriately modified semiclassical transport theory which includes anomalous velocity and side-jump contributions and microscopic Kubo-Streda perturbation theory, with particular unconventional contributions in the semiclassical theory identified with particular Feynman diagrams when calculations are carried out in a band-eigenstate representation.

We show that the phase diagram of this system contains a Weyl semimetal phase of the simplest possible kind, with only two Dirac nodes of opposite chirality, separated in momentum space, in its band structure. This Weyl semimetal has a finite anomalous Hall conductivity and chiral edge states and occurs as an intermediate phase between an ordinary insulator and a 3D quantum anomalous Hall insulator. We find that the Weyl semimetal has a nonzero dc conductivity at zero temperature, but Drude weight vanishing as T2, and is thus an unusual metallic phase, characterized by a finite anomalous Hall conductivity and topologically protected edge states. ©2011 American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {Recent reports of a large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals (FM WSMs) have led to a resurgence of interest in this enigmatic phenomenon. However, due to a lack of tunable materials, the interplay between the intrinsic mechanism caused by Berry curvature and extrinsic mechanisms due to scattering remains unclear in FM WSMs. In this contribution, we present a thorough investigation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic AHEs in a new family of FM WSMs, PrAlGe1-xSix, where x can be tuned continuously. Based on the first-principles calculations, we show that the two end members, PrAlGe and PrAlSi, have different Fermi surfaces, but similar Weyl node structures. Experimentally, we observe moderate changes in the anomalous Hall coefficient (RS), but significant changes in the ordinary Hall coefficient (R0) in PrAlGe1-xSix as a function of x. By comparing the magnitude of R0 and RS, we identify two regimes: |R0| < |RS| for x ≤ 0.5 and |R0| > |RS| for x > 0.5. Through a detailed scaling analysis, we uncover a universal anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) from intrinsic contribution when x ≤ 0.5. Such a universal AHC is absent for x > 0.5. Our study, thus, reveals the significance of extrinsic mechanisms in FM WSMs and reports the first observation of the transition from the intrinsic to extrinsic AHE in PrAlGe1-xSix.},

   abstract = {Ever since its discovery the notion of Berry phase has permeated through all branches of physics. Over the past three decades it was gradually realized that the Berry phase of the electronic wave function can have a profound effect on material properties and is responsible for a spectrum of phenomena, such as polarization, orbital magnetism, various (quantum, anomalous, or spin) Hall effects, and quantum charge pumping. This progress is summarized in a pedagogical manner in this review. A brief summary of necessary background is given and a detailed discussion of the Berry phase effect in a variety of solid-state applications. A common thread of the review is the semiclassical formulation of electron dynamics, which is a versatile tool in the study of electron dynamics in the presence of electromagnetic fields and more general perturbations. Finally, a requantization method is demonstrated that converts a semiclassical theory to an effective quantum theory. It is clear that the Berry phase should be added as an essential ingredient to our understanding of basic material properties. ©2010 The American Physical Society.},

Given our gauge invariant side jump expression, it is possible to construct a semiclassical Boltzmann theory of the anomalous Hall effect which expresses all previously identified contributions in terms of gauge invariant quantities and does not refer explicitly to off-diagonal terms in the density-matrix response. ©2006 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {The anomalous Hall effect (AHE) can be induced by intrinsic mechanisms due to the band Berry phase and extrinsic one arising from the impurity scattering. The recently discovered magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 exhibits a large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) and a giant anomalous Hall angle (AHA). The predicted energy dependence of the AHC in this material exhibits a plateau at 1000 Ω−1 cm−1 and an energy width of 100 meV just below EF, thereby implying that the large intrinsic AHC will not significantly change against small-scale energy disturbances such as slight p-doping. Here, the extrinsic contribution is successfully triggered from alien-atom scattering in addition to the intrinsic one of the pristine material by introducing a small amount of Fe dopant to substitute Co in Co3Sn2S2. The experimental results show that the AHC and AHA can be prominently enhanced up to 1850 Ω−1 cm−1 and 33%, respectively, owing to the synergistic contributions from the intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms as distinguished by the TYJ model. In particular, the tuned AHA exhibits a record value among known magnetic materials in low fields. This study opens up a pathway to engineer giant AHE in magnetic Weyl semimetals, thereby potentially advancing the topological spintronics/Weyltronics.},
