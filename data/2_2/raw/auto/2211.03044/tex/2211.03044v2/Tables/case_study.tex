(For MNLI) Examples of generated second sequence (hypothesis) by generators tuned with three different objectives conditioned on a given first sequence (premise) ``\textit{In 2009, hair samples from 1,137 Taiji residents were tested for mercury by the National Institute for Minamata Disease (NIMD)}''. The true label of the generated sequence is marked at the end of the sequence (if the generated sequence correctly pertains to the target label, it is marked in \textcolor{blue}{blue}; otherwise, it is in \textcolor{red}{red}).
