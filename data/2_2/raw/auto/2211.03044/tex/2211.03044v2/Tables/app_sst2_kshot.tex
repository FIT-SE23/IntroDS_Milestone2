\midrule
\multirow{25}{*}{positive} & \multirow{2}{*}{$\#1$} 
& (ramsay) visually transforms the dreary expanse of dead-end distaste the characters inhabit into a poem of art ,\\
& & music and metaphor .\\
& \multirow{1}{*}{$\#2$} 
& the film jolts the laughs from the audience -- as if by cattle prod . \\
& \multirow{2}{*}{$\#3$} 
& the film presents visceral and dangerously honest revelations about the men and machines behind the curtains\\
& & of our planet . \\
& \multirow{1}{*}{$\#4$} 
& a film that will enthrall the whole family . \\
& \multirow{2}{*}{$\#5$} 
& serious movie-goers embarking upon this journey will find that the road to perdition leads to a satisfying\\
& & destination . \\
& \multirow{1}{*}{$\#6$} 
& sweet and memorable film . \\
& \multirow{2}{*}{$\#7$} 
& shyamalan takes a potentially trite and overused concept (aliens come to earth) and infuses it into a \\
& & rustic , realistic , and altogether creepy tale of hidden invasion . \\
& \multirow{2}{*}{$\#8$} 
& a crisp psychological drama (and) a fascinating little thriller that would have been perfect for an old \\
& & `` twilight zone '' episode . \\
& \multirow{2}{*}{$\#9$} 
& my big fat greek wedding is not only the best date movie of the year , it 's also a -- dare i say it twice\\
& & -- delightfully charming -- and totally american , i might add -- slice of comedic bliss .\\
& \multirow{2}{*}{$\#10$} 
& a comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing\\
& & midlife crisis . \\
& \multirow{1}{*}{$\#11$} 
& diggs and lathan are among the chief reasons brown sugar is such a sweet and sexy film . \\
& \multirow{1}{*}{$\#12$} 
& you 're not merely watching history , you 're engulfed by it . \\
& \multirow{1}{*}{$\#13$} 
& the concept is a hoot . \\
& \multirow{2}{*}{$\#14$} 
& the filmmakers ' eye for detail and the high standards of performance convey a strong sense of the \\
& & girls ' environment . \\
& \multirow{1}{*}{$\#15$} 
& a haunting tale of murder and mayhem . \\
& \multirow{2}{*}{$\#16$} 
& neil burger here succeeded in ... making the mystery of four decades back the springboard for a more\\
& & immediate mystery in the present . \\
\midrule
\multirow{26}{*}{negative} & \multirow{1}{*}{$\#1$} 
& nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters .\\
& \multirow{1}{*}{$\#2$} 
& as lively an account as seinfeld is deadpan . \\
& \multirow{2}{*}{$\#3$} 
& so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter 's\\
& & the thing and loaded with actors you 're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat . \\
& \multirow{3}{*}{$\#4$} 
& the plot is nothing but boilerplate cliches from start to finish , and the script assumes that not only would\\
& & subtlety be lost on the target audience , but that it 's also too stupid to realize that they 've already seen this\\
& & exact same movie a hundred times \\
& \multirow{2}{*}{$\#5$} 
& ultimately , sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in\\
& & the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness . \\
& \multirow{2}{*}{$\#6$} 
& the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding\\
& & the filling missing . \\
& \multirow{3}{*}{$\#7$} 
& this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward\\
& & engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a\\
& & probation officer . \\
& \multirow{2}{*}{$\#8$} 
& just because a walk to remember is shrewd enough to activate girlish tear ducts does n't mean it 's good enough\\
& & for our girls . \\
& \multirow{1}{*}{$\#9$} 
& often lingers just as long on the irrelevant as on the engaging , which gradually turns what time is it there ?\\
& \multirow{1}{*}{$\#10$} 
& this movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch .\\
& \multirow{1}{*}{$\#11$} 
& but it would be better to wait for the video . \\
& \multirow{2}{*}{$\#12$} 
& a rude black comedy about the catalytic effect a holy fool has upon those around him in the cutthroat world\\
& & of children 's television .\\
& \multirow{1}{*}{$\#13$} 
& just a collection of this and that -- whatever fills time -- with no unified whole .\\
& \multirow{2}{*}{$\#14$} 
& although god is great addresses interesting matters of identity and heritage , it 's hard to shake the feeling\\
& & that it was intended to be a different kind of film . \\
& \multirow{1}{*}{$\#15$} 
& the chocolate factory without charlie . \\
& \multirow{1}{*}{$\#16$} 
& in that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting . \\
