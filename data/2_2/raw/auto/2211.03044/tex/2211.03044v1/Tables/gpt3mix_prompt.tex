\caption{
Prompts used for GPT3Mix augmentation. For sequence-pair tasks, $\bs{x}_1$ and $\bs{x}_2$ denote the first and second input sequence, respectively. For single-sequence tasks, $\bs{x}$ denotes the input sequence. $y$ denotes the label name. Only one example is shown in the template for clarity; in practice, we concatenate $k=4$ samples according to the optimal setting in GPT3Mix~\citep{Yoo2021GPT3MixLL}.
