abstract = {Full-field imaging using quantum illumination distinguishes the true image from a structured thermal background. The contrast of an image can be degraded by the presence of background light and sensor noise. To overcome this degradation, quantum illumination protocols have been theorized that exploit the spatial correlations between photon pairs. Here, we demonstrate the first full-field imaging system using quantum illumination by an enhanced detection protocol. With our current technology, we achieve a rejection of background and stray light of up to 5.8 and also report an image contrast improvement up to a factor of 11, which is resilient to both environmental noise and transmission losses. The quantum illumination protocol differs from usual quantum schemes in that the advantage is maintained even in the presence of noise and loss. Our approach may enable laboratory-based quantum imaging to be applied to real-world applications where the suppression of background light and noise is important, such as imaging under low photon flux and quantum LIDAR.}}

abstract = {Super-resolution optical microscopy is a rapidly evolving area of fluorescence microscopy with a tremendous potential for impacting many fields of science. Several super-resolution methods have been developed over the last decade, all capable of overcoming the fundamental diffraction limit of light. We present here an approach for obtaining subdiffraction limit optical resolution in all three dimensions. This method relies on higher-order statistical analysis of temporal fluctuations (caused by fluorescence blinking/intermittency) recorded in a sequence of images (movie). We demonstrate a 5-fold improvement in spatial resolution by using a conventional wide-field microscope. This resolution enhancement is achieved in iterative discrete steps, which in turn allows the evaluation of images at different resolution levels. Even at the lowest level of resolution enhancement, our method features significant background reduction and thus contrast enhancement and is demonstrated on quantum dot-labeled microtubules of fibroblast cells.}}

abstract = {We propose to use intensity correlation microscopy in combination with structured illumination to image quantum emitters that exhibit antibunching with a spatial resolution reaching far beyond the Rayleigh limit. Combining intensity measurements and intensity autocorrelations up to order m creates an effective PSF with an FWHM shrunk by the factor m. Structured illumination microscopy, on the other hand, introduces a resolution improvement of factor 2 by use of the principle of moir\&\#x00E9; fringes. Here, we show that for linear low-intensity excitation and linear optical detection, the simultaneous use of both techniques leads to a theoretically unlimited resolution power, with the improvement scaling favorably as m$+$m, dependent on the correlation order m. Hence, this technique should be of interest in microscopy for imaging a variety of samples, including biological ones. We present the underlying theory and simulations, demonstrating the highly increased spatial superresolution, and point out the requirements for an experimental implementation.},

@article{Bhusal2022,
	Abstract = {The wave nature of light imposes limits on the resolution of optical imaging systems. For over a century, the Abbe-Rayleigh criterion has been utilized to assess the spatial resolution limits of imaging instruments. Recently, there has been interest in using spatial projective measurements to enhance the resolution of imaging systems. Unfortunately, these schemes require a priori information regarding the coherence properties of ``unknown''light beams and impose stringent alignment conditions. Here, we introduce a smart quantum camera for superresolving imaging that exploits the self-learning features of artificial intelligence to identify the statistical fluctuations of unknown mixtures of light sources at each pixel. This is achieved through a universal quantum model that enables the design of artificial neural networks for the identification of photon fluctuations. Our protocol overcomes limitations of existing superresolution schemes based on spatial mode projections, and consequently provides alternative methods for microscopy, remote sensing, and astronomy.},
