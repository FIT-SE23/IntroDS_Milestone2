\section{Conclusion}

In this paper we initiate the study of online Nash welfare maximization \textit{without predictions}. We define \textit{balance ratio} and \textit{impartiality ratio} for an instance, and design online algorithms whose competitive ratios only depend on the logarithms of the aforementioned ratios of agents' utilities and the number of agents. 
One possible extension of our work is to close the gap between the lower and upper bounds in general instances.
In addition to that, our technique may provide an insight on how to remove predictions for other online problems.
