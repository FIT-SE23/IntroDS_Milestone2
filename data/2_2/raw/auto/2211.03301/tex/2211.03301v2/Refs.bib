We generalize the uncertainty relations for two quantum channels to arbitrary N quantum channels based on Wigner–Yanase skew information. We illustrate that these uncertainty inequalities are tighter than the existing ones by detailed examples.

They did not show a monotone metric, but proposed several candidates. The main result of the present paper is to provide an abundance of monotone metrics by means of operator monotone functions and to characterize them. It turns out that there is a correspondence between monotone metrics and operator means in the sense of Kubo and Ando. It follows that all proposals of Morozova and Chentsov are indeed monotone metrics.},

	abstract = {We extend the concept of Wigner{\textendash}Yanase{\textendash}Dyson skew information to something we call {\textquotedblleft}metric adjusted skew information{\textquotedblright} (of a state with respect to a conserved observable). This {\textquotedblleft}skew information{\textquotedblright} is intended to be a non-negative quantity bounded by the variance (of an observable in a state) that vanishes for observables commuting with the state. We show that the skew information is a convex function on the manifold of states. It also satisfies other requirements, proposed by Wigner and Yanase, for an effective measure-of-information content of a state relative to a conserved observable. We establish a connection between the geometrical formulation of quantum statistics as proposed by Chentsov and Morozova and measures of quantum information as introduced by Wigner and Yanase and extended in this article. We show that the set of normalized Morozova{\textendash}Chentsov functions describing the possible quantum statistics is a Bauer simplex and determine its extreme points. We determine a particularly simple skew information, the {\textquotedblleft}λ-skew information,{\textquotedblright} parametrized by a λ ∈ (0, 1], and show that the convex cone this family generates coincides with the set of all metric adjusted skew informations.},

	abstract = {Entropic uncertainty relations in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space are investigated. Making use of the majorization technique we derive explicit lower bounds for the sum of R{\'e}nyi entropies describing probability distributions associated with a given pure state expanded in eigenbases of two observables. Obtained bounds are expressed in terms of the largest singular values of submatrices of the unitary rotation matrix. Numerical simulations show that for a generic unitary matrix of size N = 5, our bound is stronger than the well-known result of Maassen and Uffink (MU) with a probability larger than 98%. We also show that the bounds investigated are invariant under the dephasing and permutation operations. Finally, we derive a classical analogue of the MU uncertainty relation, which is formulated for stochastic transition matrices.},
