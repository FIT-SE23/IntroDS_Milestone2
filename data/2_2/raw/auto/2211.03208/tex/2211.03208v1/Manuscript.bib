@article{Nivedha,
abstract = {Molecular docking programs are primarily de-signed to align rigid, drug-like fragments into the binding sites of macromolecules and frequently display poor performance when applied to flexible carbohydrate molecules. A critical source of flexibility within an oligosaccharide is the glycosidic linkages. Recently, Carbohydrate Intrinsic (CHI) energy functions were reported that attempt to quantify the glycosidic torsion angle preferences. In the present work, the CHI-energy functions have been incorporated into the AutoDock Vina (ADV) scoring function, subsequently termed Vina-Carb (VC). Two user-adjustable parameters have been introduced, namely, a CHI-energy weight term (chi{\_}coef f) that affects the magnitude of the CHI-energy penalty and a CHI-cutoff term (chi{\_}cutof f) that negates CHI-energy penalties below a specified value. A data set consisting of 101 protein−carbohydrate complexes and 29 apoprotein structures was used in the development and testing of VC, including antibodies, lectins, and carbohydrate binding modules. Accounting for the intramolecular energies of the glycosidic linkages in the oligosaccharides during docking led VC to produce acceptable structures within the top five ranked poses in 74{\%} of the systems tested, compared to a success rate of 55{\%} for ADV. An enzyme system was employed in order to illustrate the potential application of VC to proteins that may distort glycosidic linkages of carbohydrate ligands upon binding. VC represents a significant step toward accurately predicting the structures of protein−carbohydrate complexes. Furthermore, the described approach is conceptually applicable to any class of ligands that populate well-defined conformational states.},

@article{Hassan2017a,
abstract = {“Virtual Screening” is a common step of in silico drug design, where researchers screen a large library of small molecules (ligands) for interesting hits, in a process known as “Docking”. However, docking is a computationally intensive and time-consuming process, usually restricted to small size binding sites (pockets) and small number of interacting residues. When the target site is not known (blind docking), researchers split the docking box into multiple boxes, or repeat the search several times using different seeds, and then merge the results manually. Otherwise, the search time becomes impractically long. In this research, we studied the relation between the search progression and Average Sum of Proximity relative Frequencies (ASoF) of searching threads, which is closely related to the search speed and accuracy. A new inter-process spatio-temporal integration method is employed in Quick Vina 2, resulting in a new docking tool, QuickVina-W, a suitable tool for “blind docking”, (not limited in search space size or number of residues). QuickVina-W is faster than Quick Vina 2, yet better than AutoDock Vina. It should allow researchers to screen huge ligand libraries virtually, in practically short time and with high accuracy without the need to define a target pocket beforehand.},

@article{Ravindranath2015,
abstract = {Automated docking of drug-like molecules into receptors is an essential tool in structure-based drug design. While modeling receptor flexibility is important for correctly predicting ligand binding, it still remains challenging. This work focuses on an approach in which receptor flexibility is modeled by explicitly specifying a set of receptor side-chains a-priori. The challenges of this approach include the: 1) exponential growth of the search space, demanding more efficient search methods; and 2) increased number of false positives, calling for scoring functions tailored for flexible receptor docking. We present AutoDockFR-AutoDock for Flexible Receptors (ADFR), a new docking engine based on the AutoDock4 scoring function, which addresses the aforementioned challenges with a new Genetic Algorithm (GA) and customized scoring function. We validate ADFR using the Astex Diverse Set, demonstrating an increase in efficiency and reliability of its GA over the one implemented in AutoDock4. We demonstrate greatly increased success rates when cross-docking ligands into apo receptors that require side-chain conformational changes for ligand binding. These cross-docking experiments are based on two datasets: 1) SEQ17 -a receptor diversity set containing 17 pairs of apo-holo structures; and 2) CDK2 -a ligand diversity set composed of one CDK2 apo structure and 52 known bound inhibitors. We show that, when cross-docking ligands into the apo conformation of the receptors with up to 14 flexible side-chains, ADFR reports more correctly cross-docked ligands than AutoDock Vina on both datasets with solutions found for 70.6{\%} vs. 35.3{\%} systems on SEQ17, and 76.9{\%} vs. 61.5{\%} on CDK2. ADFR also outperforms AutoDock Vina in number of top ranking solutions on both datasets. Furthermore, we show that correctly docked CDK2 complexes re-create on average 79.8{\%} of all pairwise atomic interactions between the ligand and moving receptor atoms in the holo complexes. Finally, we show that down-weighting the receptor internal energy improves the ranking of correctly docked poses and that runtime for AutoDockFR scales linearly when side-chain flexibility is added.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular-docking-based virtual screening is an important tool in drug discovery that is used to significantly reduce the number of possible chemical compounds to be investigated. In addition to the selection of a sound docking strategy with appropriate scoring functions, another technical challenge is to in silico screen millions of compounds in a reasonable time. To meet this challenge, it is necessary to use high performance computing (HPC) platforms and techniques. However, the development of an integrated HPC system that makes efficient use of its elements is not trivial. RESULTS: We have developed an application termed DOVIS that uses AutoDock (version 3) as the docking engine and runs in parallel on a Linux cluster. DOVIS can efficiently dock large numbers (millions) of small molecules (ligands) to a receptor, screening 500 to 1,000 compounds per processor per day. Furthermore, in DOVIS, the docking session is fully integrated and automated in that the inputs are specified via a graphical user interface, the calculations are fully integrated with a Linux cluster queuing system for parallel processing, and the results can be visualized and queried. CONCLUSION: DOVIS removes most of the complexities and organizational problems associated with large-scale high-throughput virtual screening, and provides a convenient and efficient solution for AutoDock users to use this software in a Linux cluster platform.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Small-molecule docking is an important tool in studying receptor-ligand interactions and in identifying potential drug candidates. Previously, we developed a software tool (DOVIS) to perform large-scale virtual screening of small molecules in parallel on Linux clusters, using AutoDock 3.05 as the docking engine. DOVIS enables the seamless screening of millions of compounds on high-performance computing platforms. In this paper, we report significant advances in the software implementation of DOVIS 2.0, including enhanced screening capability, improved file system efficiency, and extended usability. IMPLEMENTATION: To keep DOVIS up-to-date, we upgraded the software's docking engine to the more accurate AutoDock 4.0 code. We developed a new parallelization scheme to improve runtime efficiency and modified the AutoDock code to reduce excessive file operations during large-scale virtual screening jobs. We also implemented an algorithm to output docked ligands in an industry standard format, sd-file format, which can be easily interfaced with other modeling programs. Finally, we constructed a wrapper-script interface to enable automatic rescoring of docked ligands by arbitrarily selected third-party scoring programs. CONCLUSION: The significance of the new DOVIS 2.0 software compared with the previous version lies in its improved performance and usability. The new version makes the computation highly efficient by automating load balancing, significantly reducing excessive file operations by more than 95{\%}, providing outputs that conform to industry standard sd-file format, and providing a general wrapper-script interface for rescoring of docked ligands.

abstract = {Structure-based virtual screening relies on scoring the predicted binding modes of compounds docked into the target. Because the accuracy of this scoring relies on the accuracy of the docking, methods that increase docking accuracy are valuable. Here, we present a relatively straightforward method for improving the probability of identifying accurately docked poses. The method is similar in concept to consensus scoring schemes, which have been shown to increase ranking power and thus hit rates, but combines information about predicted binding modes rather than predicted binding affinities. The pose prediction success rate of each docking program alone was found in this trial to be 55{\%} for Autodock, 58{\%} for DOCK, and 64{\%} for Vina. By using more than one docking program to predict the binding pose, correct poses were identified in 82{\%} or more of cases, a significant improvement. In a virtual screen, these more reliably posed compounds can be preferentially advanced to subsequent scoring stages to improve hit rates. Consensus docking can be easily introduced into established structure-based virtual screening methodologies.},

@article{Alhossary2015a,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: The need for efficient molecular docking tools for high-throughput screening is growing alongside the rapid growth of drug-fragment databases. AutoDock Vina ("Vina") is a widely used docking tool with parallelization for speed. QuickVina ("QVina 1") then further enhanced the speed via a heuristics, requiring high exhaustiveness. With low exhaustiveness, its accuracy was compromised. We present in this paper the latest version of QuickVina ("QVina 2") that inherits both the speed of QVina 1 and the reliability of the original Vina. RESULTS: We tested the efficacy of QVina 2 on the core set of PDBbind 2014. With the default exhaustiveness level of Vina (i.e. 8), a maximum of 20.49-fold and an average of 2.30-fold acceleration with a correlation coefficient of 0.967 for the first mode and 0.911 for the sum of all modes were attained over the original Vina. A tendency for higher acceleration with increased number of rotatable bonds as the design variables was observed. On the accuracy, Vina wins over QVina 2 on 30{\%} of the data with average energy difference of only 0.58 kcal/mol. On the same dataset, GOLD produced RMSD smaller than 2{\AA} on 56.9{\%} of the data while QVina 2 attained 63.1{\%}. Implementation and Availability: The C++ source code of QVina 2 is available at (www.qvina.org) CONTACT: aalhossary@pmail.ntu.edu.sg SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: available at Bioinformatics online.},

@article{OBoyle2011a,
abstract = {Background: A frequent problem in computational modeling is the interconversion of chemical structures between different formats. While standard interchange formats exist (for example, Chemical Markup Language) and de facto standards have arisen (for example, SMILES format), the need to interconvert formats is a continuing problem due to the multitude of different application areas for chemistry data, differences in the data stored by different formats (0D versus 3D, for example), and competition between software along with a lack of vendor- neutral formats. Results: We discuss, for the first time, Open Babel, an open-source chemical toolbox that speaks the many languages of chemical data. Open Babel version 2.3 interconverts over 110 formats. The need to represent such a wide variety of chemical and molecular data requires a library that implements a wide range of cheminformatics algorithms, from partial charge assignment and aromaticity detection, to bond order perception and canonicalization. We detail the implementation of Open Babel, describe key advances in the 2.3 release, and outline a variety of uses both in terms of software products and scientific research, including applications far beyond simple format interconversion. Conclusions: Open Babel presents a solution to the proliferation of multiple chemical file formats. In addition, it provides a variety of useful utilities from conformer searching and 2D depiction, to filtering, batch conversion, and substructure and similarity searching. For developers, it can be used as a programming library to handle chemical data in areas such as organic chemistry, drug design, materials science, and computational chemistry.

To narrow the gap between chemoinformatics and biology, we have developed a suite of ligand annotation, purchasability, target and biology association tools, incorporated into ZINC and meant for investigators who are not computer specialists. The new version contains over 120 million purchasable "drug-like" compounds - effectively all organic molecules that are for sale - a quarter of which are available for immediate delivery. ZINC connects purchasable compounds to high-value ones such as metabolites, drugs, natural products and annotated compounds from the literature. Compounds may be accessed by the genes they are annotated for, as well as the major and minor target classes to which those genes belong. It offers new analysis tools that are easy for non-specialists yet with few limitations for experts. ZINC retains its original 3D roots - all molecules are available in biologically relevant, ready-to-dock formats. ZINC is freely available at zinc15.docking.org.},

abstract = {KEAP1 is the key regulator of the NRF2-mediated cytoprotective response, and increasingly recognized as a target for diseases involving oxidative stress. Pharmacological intervention has focused on molecules that decrease NRF2-ubiquitination through covalent modification of KEAP1 cysteine residues, but such electrophilic compounds lack selectivity and may be associated with off-target toxicity. We report here the first use of a fragment-based approach to directly target the KEAP1 Kelch−NRF2 interaction. X-ray crystallographic screening identified three distinct “hot-spots” for fragment binding within the NRF2 binding pocket of KEAP1, allowing progression of a weak fragment hit to molecules with nanomolar affinity for KEAP1 while maintaining drug-like properties. This work resulted in a promising lead compound which exhibits tight and selective binding to KEAP1, and activates the NRF2 antioxidant response in cellular and in vivo models, thereby providing a high quality chemical probe to explore the therapeutic potential of disrupting the KEAP1−NRF2 interaction.},

abstract = {Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2) is a key regulator of oxidative stress and cellular repair and can be activated through inhibition of its cytoplasmic repressor, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1). Several small molecule disrupters of the Nrf2-Keap1 complex have recently been tested and/or approved for human therapeutic use but lack either potency or selectivity. The main goal of our work was to develop a potent, selective activator of NRF2 as protection against oxidative stress. In human bronchial epithelial cells, our Nrf2 activator, 3-(pyridin-3-ylsulfonyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-chromen-2-one (PSTC), induced Nrf2 nuclear translocation, Nrf2-regulated gene expression, and downstream signaling events, including induction of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) enzyme activity and heme oxygenase-1 protein expression, in an Nrf2-dependent manner. As a marker of subsequent functional activity, PSTC restored oxidant (tert-butyl hydroperoxide)-induced glutathione depletion. The compound's engagement of the Nrf2 signaling pathway translated to an in vivo setting, with induction of Nrf2-regulated gene expression and NQO1 enzyme activity, as well as restoration of oxidant (ozone)-induced glutathione depletion, occurring in the lungs of PSTC-treated rodents. Under disease conditions, PSTC engaged its target, inducing the expression of Nrf2-regulated genes in human bronchial epithelial cells derived from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as in the lungs of cigarette smoke-exposed mice. Subsequent to the latter, a dose-dependent inhibition of cigarette smoke-induced pulmonary inflammation was observed. Finally, in contrast with bardoxolone methyl and sulforaphane, PSTC did not inhibit interleukin-1$\beta$-induced nuclear factor-$\kappa$B translocation or insulin-induced S6 phosphorylation in human cells, emphasizing the on-target activity of this compound. In summary, we characterize a potent, selective Nrf2 activator that offers protection against pulmonary oxidative stress in several cellular and in vivo models.},

Activators of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) could lead to promising therapeutics for prevention and treatment of oxidative stress and inflammatory disorders. Ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the transcription factor NRF2 is mediated by Kelch-like ECH-associated protein-1 (KEAP1). Inhibition of the KEAP1/NRF2 interaction with small molecules leads to NRF2 activation. Previously, we and others described naphthalene-based NRF2 activators, but the 1,4-diaminonaphthalene scaffold may not represent a drug-like scaffold. Paying particular attention to aqueous solubility, metabolic stability, potency, and mutagenicity, we modified a previously known, naphthalene-based nonelectrophilic NRF2 activator to give a series of non-naphthalene and heterocyclic scaffolds. We found that, compared to previously reported naphthalene-based compounds, a 1,4-isoquinoline scaffold provides a better mutagenic profile without sacrificing potency, stability, or solubility.},

abstract = {Keap1 binds to the Nrf2 transcription factor to promote its degradation, resulting in the loss of gene products that protect against oxidative stress. While cell-active small molecules have been identified that modify cysteines in Keap1 and effect the Nrf2 dependent pathway, few act through a non-covalent mechanism. We have identified and characterized several small molecule compounds that specifically bind to the Keap1 Kelch-DC domain as measured by NMR, native mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography. One compound upregulates Nrf2 response genes measured by a luciferase cell reporter assay. The non-covalent inhibition strategy presents a reasonable course of action to avoid toxic side-effects due to non-specific cysteine modification. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The authors present fragment screening data obtained using a label-free parallel analysis approach where the binding of fragment library compounds to 4 different target proteins can be screened simultaneously using surface plasmon resonance detection. They suggest this method as a first step in fragment screening to identify and select binders, reducing the demanding requirements on subsequent X-ray or nuclear magnetic resonance studies, and as a valuable "clean-up" tool to eliminate unwanted promiscuous binders from libraries. A small directed fragment library of known thrombin binders and a general 500-compound fragment library were used in this study. Thrombin, blocked thrombin, carbonic anhydrase, and glutathione-S-transferase were immobilized on the sensor chip surface, and the direct binding of the fragments was studied in real time. Only 12 $\mu$g of each protein is needed for screening of a 3000-compound fragment library. For screening, a binding site-blocked target as reference facilitates the identification of binding site-selective hits and the signals from other reference proteins for the elimination of false positives. The scope and limitations of this screening approach are discussed for both target-directed and general fragment libraries. {\textcopyright} 2008 Society for Biomolecular Sciences.},

@article{Irwin2015,
abstract = {Colloidal aggregation of organic molecules is the dominant mechanism for artifactual inhibition of proteins, and controls against it are widely deployed. Notwithstanding an increasingly detailed understanding of this phenomenon, a method to reliably predict aggregation has remained elusive. Correspondingly, active molecules that act via aggregation continue to be found in early discovery campaigns and remain common in the literature. Over the past decade, over 12 thousand aggregating organic molecules have been identified, potentially enabling a precedent-based approach to match known aggregators with new molecules that may be expected to aggregate and lead to artifacts. We investigate an approach that uses lipophilicity, affinity, and similarity to known aggregators to advise on the likelihood that a candidate compound is an aggregator. In prospective experimental testing, five of seven new molecules with Tanimoto coefficients (Tc's) between 0.95 and 0.99 to known aggregators aggregated at relevant concentrations. Ten of 19 with Tc's between 0.94 and 0.90 and three of seven with Tc's between 0.89 and 0.85 also aggregated. Another three of the predicted compounds aggregated at higher concentrations. This method finds that 61»827 or 5.1{\%} of the ligands acting in the 0.1 to 10 $\mu$M range in the medicinal chemistry literature are at least 85{\%} similar to a known aggregator with these physical properties and may aggregate at relevant concentrations. Intriguingly, only 0.73{\%} of all drug-like commercially available compounds resemble the known aggregators, suggesting that colloidal aggregators are enriched in the literature. As a percentage of the literature, aggregator-like compounds have increased 9-fold since 1995, partly reflecting the advent of high-throughput and virtual screens against molecular targets. Emerging from this study is an aggregator advisor database and tool (http://advisor.bkslab.org), free to the community, that may help distinguish between fruitful and artifactual screening hits acting by this mechanism.},

abstract = {Introduction: PPIs are involved in every disease and specific modulation of these PPIs with small molecules would significantly improve our prospects of developing therapeutic agents. Both industry and academia have engaged in the identification and use of PPI inhibitors. However in comparison, the opposite strategy of employing small-molecule stabilizers of PPIs is underrepresented in drug discovery. Areas covered: PPI stabilization has not been exploited in a systematic manner. Rather, this concept validated by a number of therapeutically used natural products like rapamycin and paclitaxel has been shown retrospectively to be the basis of the activity of synthetic molecules originating from drug discovery projects among them lenalidomide and tafamidis. Here, the authors cover the growing number of synthetic small-molecule PPI stabilizers to advocate for a stronger consideration of this as a drug discovery approach. Expert opinion: Both the natural products and the growing number of synthetic molecules show that PPI stabilization is a viable strategy for drug discovery. There is certainly a significant challenge to adapt compound libraries, screening techniques and downstream methodologies to identify, characterize and optimize PPI stabilizers, but the examples of molecules reviewed here in our opinion justify these efforts.},

In an effort to assess the reliability of these alerts as indicators of pan-assay interference, we performed a large-scale analysis of the impact of PAINS alerts on compound promiscuity in bioassays using publicly available data in PubChem.

abstract = {Induced protein degradation by PROTACs has emerged as a promising strategy to target nonenzymatic proteins inside the cell. The aim of this study was to identify Keap1, a substrate adaptor protein for ubiquitin E3 ligase involved in oxidative stress regulation, as a novel candidate for PROTACs that can be applied in the degradation of the nonenzymatic protein Tau. A peptide PROTAC by recruiting Keap1-Cul3 ubiquitin E3 ligase was developed and applied in the degradation of intracellular Tau. Peptide 1 showed strong in vitro binding with Keap1 and Tau. With proper cell permeability, peptide 1 was found to colocalize with cellular Keap1 and resulted in the coimmunoprecipitation of Tau and Keap1. The results of flow cytometry and western blotting assays showed that peptide 1 can downregulate the intracellular Tau level in both time- and concentration-dependent manner. The application of Keap1 siRNA silencing and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 confirmed that peptide 1 could promote the Keap1-dependent poly-ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of Tau. The results suggested that using PROTACs to recruit Keap1 to induce the degradation of Tau may show promising character in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease. Besides, our research demonstrated that Keap1 should be a promising E3 ligase adaptor to be used in the design of novel PROTACs.},

abstract = {A critical barrier to entry into structure-based virtual screening is the lack of a suitable, easy to access database of purchasable compounds. We have therefore prepared a library of 727,842 molecules, each with 3D structure, using catalogs of compounds from vendors (the size of this library continues to grow). The molecules have been assigned biologically relevant protonation states and are annotated with properties such as molecular weight, calculated LogP, and number of rotatable bonds. Each molecule in the library contains vendor and purchasing information and is ready for docking using a number of popular docking programs. Within certain limits, the molecules are prepared in multiple protonation states and multiple tautomeric forms. In one format, multiple conformations are available for the molecules. This database is available for free download (http://zinc.docking.org) in several common file formats including SMILES, mol2, 3D SDF, and DOCK flexibase format. A Web-based query tool incorporating a molecular drawing interface enables the database to be searched and browsed and subsets to be created. Users can process their own molecules by uploading them to a server. Our hope is that this database will bring virtual screening libraries to a wide community of structural biologists and medicinal chemists.},

abstract = {Structure-based docking screens of large compound libraries have become common in early drug and probe discovery. As computer efficiency has improved and compound libraries have grown, the ability to screen hundreds of millions, and even billions, of compounds has become feasible for modest-sized computer clusters. This allows the rapid and cost-effective exploration and categorization of vast chemical space into a subset enriched with potential hits for a given target. To accomplish this goal at speed, approximations are used that result in undersampling of possible configurations and inaccurate predictions of absolute binding energies. Accordingly, it is important to establish controls, as are common in other fields, to enhance the likelihood of success in spite of these challenges. Here we outline best practices and control docking calculations that help evaluate docking parameters for a given target prior to undertaking a large-scale prospective screen, with exemplification in one particular target, the melatonin receptor, where following this procedure led to direct docking hits with activities in the subnanomolar range. Additional controls are suggested to ensure specific activity for experimentally validated hit compounds. These guidelines should be useful regardless of the docking software used. Docking software described in the outlined protocol (DOCK3.7) is made freely available for academic research to explore new hits for a range of targets.},

We show that a model trained with 1 million structures (0.1% of the database) reproduces 68.9% of the entire database after training, when sampling 2 billion molecules. We also developed a method to assess the quality of the training process using negative log-likelihood plots. Furthermore, we use a mathematical model based on the "coupon collector problem" that compares the trained model to an upper bound and thus we are able to quantify how much it has learned. We also suggest that this method can be used as a tool to benchmark the learning capabilities of any molecular generative model architecture. Additionally, an analysis of the generated chemical space was performed, which shows that, mostly due to the syntax of SMILES, complex molecules with many rings and heteroatoms are more difficult to sample.},

abstract = {The MQN-mapplet is a Java application giving access to the structure of small molecules in large databases via color-coded maps of their chemical space. These maps are projections from a 42-dimensional property space defined by 42 integer value descriptors called molecular quantum numbers (MQN), which count different categories of atoms, bonds, polar groups, and topological features and categorize molecules by size, rigidity, and polarity. Despite its simplicity, MQN-space is relevant to biological activities. The MQN-mapplet allows localization of any molecule on the color-coded images, visualization of the molecules, and identification of analogs as neighbors on the MQN-map or in the original 42-dimensional MQN-space. No query molecule is necessary to start the exploration, which may be particularly attractive for nonchemists. To our knowledge, this type of interactive exploration tool is unprecedented for very large databases such as PubChem and GDB-13 (almost one billion molecules). The application is freely available for download at www.gdb.unibe.ch.},

To assess the chemical space available for drug design, our group investigates the generated databases (GDBs) listing all possible organic molecules up to a defined size, the largest of which is GDB-17 featuring 166.4 billion molecules up to 17 non-hydrogen atoms. While known drugs and bioactive compounds are mostly aromatic and planar, the GDBs contain a plethora of non-aromatic 3D-shaped molecules, which are very useful for drug discovery since they generally have more desirable absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties. Here we review GDB enumeration methods and the selection and synthesis of GDB molecules as modulators of ion channels. We summarize the constitution of GDB subsets focusing on fragments (FDB17), medicinal chemistry (GDBMedChem) and ChEMBL-like molecules (GDBChEMBL), and the ring system database GDB4c as a rich source of novel 3D-shaped chiral molecules containing quaternary centers, such as the recently reported trinorbornane.},

abstract = {All molecules of up to 11 atoms of C, N, O, and F possible under consideration of simple valency, chemical stability, and synthetic feasibility rules were generated and collected in a database (GDB). GDB contains 26.4 million molecules (110.9 million stereoisomers), including three- and four-membered rings and triple bonds. By comparison, only 63 857 compounds of up to 11 atoms were found in public databases (a combination of PubChem, ChemACX, ChemSCX, NCI open database, and the Merck Index). A total of 538 of the 1208 ring systems in GDB are currently unknown in the CAS Registry and Beilstein databases in any carbon/heteroatom/multiple-bond combination or as a substructure. Over 70% of GDB molecules are chiral. Because of their small size, all compounds obey Lipinski's bioavailability rule. A total of 13.2 million compounds also follow Congreve's "Rule of 3" for lead-likeness. A Kohonen map trained with autocorrelation descriptors organizes GDB according to compound classes and shows that leadlike compounds are most abundant in chiral regions of fused carbocycles and fused heterocycles. The projection of known compounds into this map indicates large uncharted areas of chemical space. The potential of GDB for drug discovery is illustrated by virtual screening for kinase inhibitors, G-protein coupled receptor ligands, and ion-channel modulators.

abstract = {Virtual high throughput screening of in-house compound collections and vendor catalogs is a validated approach in the quest for novel molecular entities. However , these libraries are small compared to the overall synthesizable number of compounds from validated "wet" chemical reactions in pharma companies or the public domain. In order to overcome this limitation, we designed a large virtual combinatorial chemistry space from publicly available combinatorial libraries that gives access to billions of synthetically accessible compounds. Together with FTrees, a fuzzy similarity calculator, the researcher has a means of searching this KnowledgeSpace for analogues to one or several query molecules within a few minutes. The resulting compounds not only exhibit similar properties to the query molecule(s), but also feature an annotation through which of the synthetic routes these molecules can be made. Results can be expected to be diverse, based on FTrees scaffold hopping capabilities, and provide ideas for hit follow-up into novel compound classes. In this contribution we present the design and properties of the KnowledgeSpace and other in-house chemistry spaces that build on the same strategy as well as validation of results and a number of successful applications including prospective results.},

Traditionally this is achieved by comparing the members of the chemical libraries individually for identity. This approach becomes impractical when operating on chemical libraries exceeding billions or even trillions of compounds in size. As a result, no such analysis exists for ultralarge chemical spaces like the Enamine REAL Space containing over 20 billion compounds. In this work, we present a novel tool called SpaceCompare for the overlap calculation of large, nonenumerable combinatorial fragment spaces. In contrast to existing methods, SpaceCompare utilizes topological fingerprints and the combinatorial character of these chemical spaces. The tool is able to determine the exact overlap of prominent spaces like Enamine's REAL Space, WuXi's GalaXi Space, and Otava's CHEMriya for the first time.},

abstract = {The neuromodulator melatonin synchronizes circadian rhythms and related physiological functions via actions at two G protein-coupled receptors: MT1 and MT2. Circadian release of high nighttime levels of melatonin from the pineal gland activates melatonin receptors in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, synchronizing physiology and behavior to the light-dark cycle1-4. The two receptors are established drug targets for aligning circadian phase in disorders of sleep5,6 and depression7,1-4,8,9. Despite their importance, few if any in vivo active MT1 selective ligands have been reported2,8,10-12, hampering both the understanding of circadian biology and the development of targeted therapeutics. Here we docked over 150 million virtual molecules against an MT1 crystal structure, prioritizing structural fit and chemical novelty. Thirty-eight high-ranking molecules were synthesized and tested, revealing ligands in the 470 pM to 6 $\mu$M range. Structure-based optimization led to two selective MT1 inverse agonists, topologically unrelated to previously explored chemotypes, that were tested in mouse models of circadian behavior. Unexpectedly, the MT1-selective inverse agonists advanced the phase of the mouse circadian clock by 1.3-1.5 hrs when given at subjective dusk, an agonist-like effect eliminated in MT1- but not in MT2-knockout mice. This study illustrates opportunities for modulating melatonin receptor biology via MT1-selective ligands, and for the discovery of new, in vivo-active chemotypes from structure-based screens of diverse, ultra-large libraries.},

abstract = {The $\sigma$2 receptor has attracted intense interest in cancer imaging1, psychiatric disease2, neuropathic pain3–5 and other areas of biology6,7. Here we determined the crystal structure of this receptor in complex with the clinical candidate roluperidone2 and the tool compound PB288. These structures templated a large-scale docking screen of 490 million virtual molecules, of which 484 compounds were synthesized and tested. We identified 127 new chemotypes with affinities superior to 1 $\mu$M, 31 of which had affinities superior to 50 nM. The hit rate fell smoothly and monotonically with docking score. We optimized three hits for potency and selectivity, and achieved affinities that ranged from 3 to 48 nM, with up to 250-fold selectivity versus the $\sigma$1 receptor. Crystal structures of two ligands bound to the $\sigma$2 receptor confirmed the docked poses. To investigate the contribution of the $\sigma$2 receptor in pain, two potent $\sigma$2-selective ligands and one potent $\sigma$1/$\sigma$2 non-selective ligand were tested for efficacy in a mouse model of neuropathic pain. All three ligands showed time-dependent decreases in mechanical hypersensitivity in the spared nerve injury model9, suggesting that the $\sigma$2 receptor has a role in nociception.

Several compounds, including the initial docking hit ‘9087 [mean effective concentration (EC 50 ) of 52 nanomolar] and two analogs, ‘7075 and PS75 (EC 50 4.1 and 4.8 nanomolar), exerted on-target analgesic activity in multiple in vivo pain models without sedation.

abstract = {Human T-cell leukemia virus type-1 (HTLV-1) is the first pathogenic retrovirus discovered in human. Although HTLV-1-induced diseases are well characterized and linked to the encoded Tax-1 protein, there is currently no strategy to target Tax-1 functions with small molecules. Here, we report a comprehensive interaction map between Tax-1 and human PDZ domain-containing proteins (hPDZome), and we show that Tax-1 interacts with one-third of them. This includes proteins involved in cell cycle, cell-cell junction and cytoskeleton organization, as well as in membrane complexes assembly. Using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, we have determined the structural basis of the interaction between the C-terminal PDZ binding motif (PBM) of Tax-1, and the PDZ domains of DLG1 and syntenin-1. Finally, we have used molecular modeling and mammalian cell-based assays to demonstrate that Tax-1/PDZ-domain interactions are amenable to small-molecule inhibition. Thus, our work provides a framework for the design of targeted therapies for HTLV-1-induced diseases.Highlightscomprehensive interactome map of HTLV-1 Tax / human PDZ proteinsbasis of Tax-1 PBM binding to human DLG1 and syntenin-1 PDZ domains”.significance of inhibiting Tax-1 functionsof the Tax-1 / PDZ interfaceCompeting Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

However, a need still exists for cheap, effective therapeutics, and targeting multiple points in the viral life cycle could help tackle the current, as well as future, coronaviruses. Here, we leverage our recently developed, ultra-large-scale in silico screening platform, VirtualFlow, to search for inhibitors that target SARS-CoV-2. In this unprecedented structure-based virtual campaign, we screened roughly 1 billion molecules against each of 40 different target sites on 17 different potential viral and host targets. In addition to targeting the active sites of viral enzymes, we also targeted critical auxiliary sites such as functionally important protein-protein interactions.},

The objectives of the present study were 1) to assess the emotional response to new products (fruit and vegetable smoothies in a drink pouch) in two different scenarios: looking at the smoothie pouch, or tasting the smoothie with the smoothie pouch alongside; 2) to compare the information obtained when the participants use photographs or use words to express emotions. In the Pack-alone scenario, similar emotional spaces and sample configurations were obtained with both images and words. In the Pack-and-tasting scenario, the richness of the emotional response increased when using images. In both scenarios, the participants used a greater number of negative emotions when these were presented as images rather than as words. This could be considered an advantage, as it enables some negative emotional loads to be portrayed. The present results also demonstrate that evaluating the emotional response allows effective discrimination between samples with similar overall liking scores.},

abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort 1–4 , the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined 5 , but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences 6,7 . Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem' 8 —has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years 9 . Despite recent progress 10–14 , existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14) 15 , demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

abstract = {M pro , the main protease of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is essential for the viral life cycle. Accordingly, several groups have performed in silico screens to identify M pro inhibitors that might be used to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections. We selected more than five hundred compounds from the top-ranking hits of two very large in silico screens for on-demand synthesis. We then examined whether these compounds could bind to M pro and inhibit its protease activity. Two interesting chemotypes were identified, which were further evaluated by characterizing an additional five hundred synthesis on-demand analogues. The compounds of the first chemotype denatured M pro and were considered not useful for further development. The compounds of the second chemotype bound to and enhanced the melting temperature of M pro . The most active compound from this chemotype inhibited M pro in vitro with an IC 50 value of 1 $\mu$M and suppressed replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in tissue culture cells. Its mode of binding to M pro was determined by X-ray crystallography, revealing that it is a non-covalent inhibitor. We propose that the inhibitors described here could form the basis for medicinal chemistry efforts that could lead to the development of clinically relevant inhibitors.},

The advent of ultra-large virtual screens, in which hundreds of millions to billions of compounds are screened, has proven to be a powerful approach to discover highly potent hit compounds. However, these developments are just the tip of the iceberg, with new technologies and methods emerging to propel the field forward. Examples include novel machine-learning approaches, which can reduce the computational costs of virtual screening dramatically, while progress in quantum-mechanical approaches can increase the accuracy of predictions of various small molecule properties.},

Here, we add support of PLANTS to VirtualFlow (VirtualFlow Ants), which adds a valuable method for primary virtual screenings and rescoring procedures.

The on the fly conversion is carried out with Open Babel and the program SPORES. We applied VirtualFlow Ants to a test system involving KEAP1 on the Google Cloud up to 128,000 CPUs, and the observed scaling behavior is approximately linear. Furthermore, we have adjusted several central docking parameters of PLANTS (such as the speed parameter or the number of ants) and screened 10 million compounds for each of the 10 resulting docking scenarios. We analyzed their docking scores and average docking times, which are key factors in virtual screenings. The possibility of carrying out ultra-large virtual screening with PLANTS via VirtualFlow Ants opens new avenues in computational drug discovery.},

abstract = {Molecular docking remains an important tool for structure-based screening to find new ligands and chemical probes. As docking ambitions grow to include new scoring function terms, and to address ever more targets, the reliability and extendability of the orientation sampling, and the throughput of the method, become pressing. Here we explore sampling techniques that eliminate stochastic behavior in DOCK3.6, allowing us to optimize the method for regularly variable sampling of orientations. This also enabled a focused effort to optimize the code for efficiency, with a three-fold increase in the speed of the program. This, in turn, facilitated extensive testing of the method on the 102 targets, 22,805 ligands and 1,411,214 decoys of the Directory of Useful Decoys-Enhanced (DUD-E) benchmarking set, at multiple levels of sampling. Encouragingly, we observe that as sampling increases from 50 to 500 to 2000 to 5000 to 20,000 molecular orientations in the binding site (and so from about 1×10(10) to 4×10(10) to 1×10(11) to 2×10(11) to 5×10(11) mean atoms scored per target, since multiple conformations are sampled per orientation), the enrichment of ligands over decoys monotonically increases for most DUD-E targets. Meanwhile, including internal electrostatics in the evaluation ligand conformational energies, and restricting aromatic hydroxyls to low energy rotamers, further improved enrichment values. Several of the strategies used here to improve the efficiency of the code are broadly applicable in the field.},

abstract = {The crystal structure of the Midwest Center for Structural Genomics target APC35832, a 14.7-kDa cytosolic protein from Bacillus stearothermophilus, has been determined at 1.3 A resolution by the single anomalous diffraction method from a mercury soaked crystal. The APC35832 protein is a representative of large group of bacterial and archeal proteins entirely consisting of the Toprim (topoisomerase-primase) domain. This domain is found in the catalytic centers of many enzymes catalyzing phosphodiester bond formation or cleavage, but the function of small Toprim domain proteins remains unknown. Consistent with the sequence analysis, the APC35832 structure shows a conserved Toprim fold, with a central 4-stranded parallel beta-sheet surrounded by four alpha-helixes. Comparison of the APC35832 structure with its closest structural homolog, the catalytic core of bacteriophage T7 primase, revealed structural conservation of a metal binding site and isothermal titration calorimetry indicates that APC35832 binds Mg2+ with a sub-millimolar dissociation constant (K(d)). The APC35832-Mg2+ complex structure was determined at 1.65 A and reveals the role of conserved acidic residues in Mg2+ ion coordination. The structural similarities to other Toprim domain containing proteins and potential function and substrates of APC35832 are discussed in this article.},

@article{Fan2019,
abstract = {Background: In recent years, since the molecular docking technique can greatly improve the efficiency and reduce the research cost, it has become a key tool in computer-assisted drug design to predict the binding affinity and analyze the interactive mode. Results: This study introduces the key principles, procedures and the widely-used applications for molecular docking. Also, it compares the commonly used docking applications and recommends which research areas are suitable for them. Lastly, it briefly reviews the latest progress in molecular docking such as the integrated method and deep learning. Conclusion: Limited to the incomplete molecular structure and the shortcomings of the scoring function, current docking applications are not accurate enough to predict the binding affinity. However, we could improve the current molecular docking technique by integrating the big biological data into scoring function. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].},

@article{Pagadala2017,
abstract = {Molecular docking methodology explores the behavior of small molecules in the binding site of a target protein. As more protein structures are determined experimentally using X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, molecular docking is increasingly used as a tool in drug discovery. Docking against homology-modeled targets also becomes possible for proteins whose structures are not known. With the docking strategies, the druggability of the compounds and their specificity against a particular target can be calculated for further lead optimization processes. Molecular docking programs perform a search algorithm in which the conformation of the ligand is evaluated recursively until the convergence to the minimum energy is reached. Finally, an affinity scoring function, $\Delta$G [U total in kcal/mol], is employed to rank the candidate poses as the sum of the electrostatic and van der Waals energies. The driving forces for these specific interactions in biological systems aim toward complementarities between the shape and electrostatics of the binding site surfaces and the ligand or substrate.},

In this review, recent improvements in several public domain packages that are widely used in the context of drug development, including DOCK, AutoDock, AutoDock Vina and Screening for Ligands by Induced-fit Docking Efficiently (SLIDE) are surveyed. The authors also survey methods for the analysis and visualisation of docking simulations, as an important step in the overall assessment of the results. In order to illustrate the performance and limitations of current docking programs, the authors used the National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) oestrogen receptor benchmark set of 232 oestrogenic compounds with experimentally measured strength of binding to oestrogen receptor alpha. The methods tested here yielded a correlation coefficient of up to 0.6 between the predicted and observed binding affinities for active compounds in this benchmark.},

@article{Du2022,
abstract = {Molecule design is a fundamental problem in molecular science and has critical applications in a variety of areas, such as drug discovery, material science, etc. However, due to the large searching space, it is impossible for human experts to enumerate and test all molecules in wet-lab experiments. Recently, with the rapid development of machine learning methods, especially generative methods, molecule design has achieved great progress by leveraging machine learning models to generate candidate molecules. In this paper, we systematically review the most relevant work in machine learning models for molecule design. We start with a brief review of the mainstream molecule featurization and representation methods (including 1D string, 2D graph, and 3D geometry) and general generative methods (deep generative and combinatorial optimization methods). Then we summarize all the existing molecule design problems into several venues according to the problem setup, including input, output types and goals. Finally, we conclude with the open challenges and point out future opportunities of machine learning models for molecule design in real-world applications.},

@article{Li2021,
abstract = {Molecular docking predicts whether and how small molecules bind to a macromolecular target using a suitable 3D structure. Scoring functions for structure-based virtual screening primarily aim at discovering which molecules bind to the considered target when these form part of a library with a much higher proportion of non-binders. Classical scoring functions are essentially models building a linear mapping between the features describing a protein–ligand complex and its binding label. Machine learning, a major subfield of artificial intelligence, can also be used to build fast supervised learning models for this task. In this review, we analyzed such machine-learning scoring functions for structure-based virtual screening in the period 2015–2019. We have discussed what the shortcomings of current benchmarks really mean and what valid alternatives have been employed. The latter retrospective studies observed that machine-learning scoring functions were substantially more accurate, in terms of higher hit rates and potencies, than the classical scoring functions they were compared to. Several of these machine-learning scoring functions were also employed in prospective studies, in which mid-nanomolar binders with novel chemical structures were directly discovered without any potency optimization. We have thus highlighted the codes and webservers that are available to build or apply machine-learning scoring functions to prospective structure-based virtual screening studies. A discussion of prospects for future work completes this review. This article is categorized under: Computer and Information Science > Chemoinformatics.},

@article{Kimber2021,
abstract = {Drug discovery is a cost and time-intensive process that is often assisted by computational methods, such as virtual screening, to speed up and guide the design of new compounds. For many years, machine learning methods have been successfully applied in the context of computer-aided drug discovery. Recently, thanks to the rise of novel technologies as well as the increasing amount of available chemical and bioactivity data, deep learning has gained a tremendous impact in rational active compound discovery. Herein, recent applications and developments of machine learning, with a focus on deep learning, in virtual screening for active compound design are reviewed. This includes introducing different compound and protein encodings, deep learning techniques as well as frequently used bioactivity and benchmark data sets for model training and testing. Finally, the present state-of-the-art, including the current challenges and emerging problems, are examined and discussed.},
