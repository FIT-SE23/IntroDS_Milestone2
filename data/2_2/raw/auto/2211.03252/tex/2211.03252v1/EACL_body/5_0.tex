Natural language explanations are prevalent in various applications: we use language explanations to define abstract terminologies and describe real-world objects. Taking this observation, in this section we evaluate whether \model{} can be extended to other modalities. Due to lack of datasets on evaluating zero-shot classification with compositional natural language explanations, we augment two standard classification datasets on text and image classification with manually collected explanations. Specifically, we select CUB~\citep{wah2011caltech}, a bird image classification, as the recognition of birds benefits more from their compositional features (such as colors, shapes, etc.). We also use a legal text dataset, ECtHR~\citep{branting2021scalable}, because experts readily provides official definitions of the legal terms, and explanations are important in legal domain.
