The proposed approach focuses more on logical reasoning on explanations for zero-shot classification. The semantic structures in explanations, such as inter-entity relations and event argument relations, are less touched (although the pre-trained language encoders such as BERT provides semantic matching ability to some extent). Within the range of logical reasoning, our focus are more on first-order logic, while leaving the discussion about higher-order logic for future work.
