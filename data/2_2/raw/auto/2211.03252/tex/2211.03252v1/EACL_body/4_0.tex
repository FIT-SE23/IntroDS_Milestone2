In this section we conduct in-depth analysis of our proposed approach towards zero-shot classification with explanations. We start with a latest benchmark, CLUES~\citep{menon2022clues}, which evaluates the performance of classifier learning with natural language explanations. CLUES benchmark focus on the modality of structured data, where input data is a table of features describing an item. This data format is flexible enough for computers on a wide range of applications, and also benefits quantitative analysis in the rest part of this section. In the next section (\ref{sec:other_modalities}), we also extend to more datasets and modalities.
