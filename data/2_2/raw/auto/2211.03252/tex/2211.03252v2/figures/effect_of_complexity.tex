\caption{The classification accuracy on zero-shot tasks in CLUES plotted against the proportion of compositional explanations. (There are multiple tasks with only simple explanations, so there are multiple points at $x=0$ position.)
% Our model's performance generally remains stable across different types of tasks, but ExEnt performs worse when the task contains more compositional definitions.
