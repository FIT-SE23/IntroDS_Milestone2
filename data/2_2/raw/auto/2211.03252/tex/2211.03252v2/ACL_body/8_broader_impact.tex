This work is related to and partially inspired by the real-world task of legal text classification. As legal matters can affect the life of real people, and we are yet to fully understand the behaviors of deep-learning-based models, relying more on human expert opinions is still a more prudent choice. While the proposed approach can be utilized for automating the process of legal text, care must be taken before using or referring to the result produced by any machine in legal domain.
