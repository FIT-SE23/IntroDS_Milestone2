	journal = {Machine Learning: Science and Technology},
	abstract = {Data-driven transformations that reformulate nonlinear systems in a linear framework have the potential to enable the prediction, estimation, and control of strongly nonlinear dynamics using linear systems theory. The Koopman operator has emerged as a principled linear embedding of nonlinear dynamics, and its eigenfunctions establish intrinsic coordinates along which the dynamics behave linearly. Previous studies have used finite-dimensional approximations of the Koopman operator for model-predictive control approaches. In this work, we illustrate a fundamental closure issue of this approach and argue that it is beneficial to first validate eigenfunctions and then construct reduced-order models in these validated eigenfunctions. These coordinates form a Koopman-invariant subspace by design and, thus, have improved predictive power. We show then how the control can be formulated directly in these intrinsic coordinates and discuss potential benefits and caveats of this perspective. The resulting control architecture is termed Koopman Reduced Order Nonlinear Identification and Control (KRONIC). It is further demonstrated that these eigenfunctions can be approximated with data-driven regression and power series expansions, based on the partial differential equation governing the infinitesimal generator of the Koopman operator. Validating discovered eigenfunctions is crucial and we show that lightly damped eigenfunctions may be faithfully extracted from EDMD or an implicit formulation. These lightly damped eigenfunctions are particularly relevant for control, as they correspond to nearly conserved quantities that are associated with persistent dynamics, such as the Hamiltonian. KRONIC is then demonstrated on a number of relevant examples, including (a) a nonlinear system with a known linear embedding, (b) a variety of Hamiltonian systems, and (c) a high-dimensional double-gyre model for ocean mixing.}

In this paper, a cloud-computing based power system simulator, namely CloudPSS, is designed. Based on an open service integrating framework, a self-developed electromagnetic transients (EMT) simulator with an automatic code generator is provided to accelerate EMT simulations using heterogeneous computing devices in the cloud, such as CPU and GPU. Test results show that the CloudPSS platform can achieve significant speedups for both large-scale simulation tasks and multi-scenario tasks. Moreover, benefit from the time-sharing of cloud computing resources, the computational cost can be greatly reduced.}

abstract = {In this paper we propose an approach based on an Online Feedback Optimization (OFO) controller with grid input–output sensitivity estimation for real-time grid operation, e.g., at subsecond time scales. The OFO controller uses grid measurements as feedback to update the value of the controllable elements in the grid, and track the solution of a time-varying AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF). Instead of relying on a full grid model, e.g., grid admittance matrix, OFO only requires the steady-state sensitivity relating a change in the controllable inputs, e.g., power injections set-points, to a change in the measured outputs, e.g., voltage magnitudes. Since an inaccurate sensitivity may lead to a model-mismatch and jeopardize the performance, we propose a recursive least-squares estimation that enables OFO to learn the sensitivity from measurements during real-time operation, turning OFO into a model-free approach. We analytically certify the convergence of the proposed OFO with sensitivity estimation, and validate its performance on a simulation using the IEEE 123-bus test feeder, and comparing it against a state-of-the-art OFO with constant sensitivity.}
