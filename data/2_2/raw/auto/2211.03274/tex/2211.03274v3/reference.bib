  abstract = {Exposure to high levels of air pollutant concentration is known to be associated with respiratory problems which can translate into higher morbidity and mortality rates. The link between air pollution and population health has mainly been assessed considering air quality and hospitalisation or mortality data. However, this approach limits the analysis to individuals characterised by severe conditions. In this paper we evaluate the link between air pollution and respiratory diseases using general practice drug prescriptions for chronic respiratory diseases, which allow to draw conclusions based on the general population. We propose a two-stage statistical approach: in the first stage we specify a space-time model to estimate the monthly NO2 concentration integrating several data sources characterised by different spatio-temporal resolution; in the second stage we link the concentration to the β2-agonists prescribed monthly by general practices in England and we model the prescription rates through a small area approach.},

 abstract = {An autologistic regression model consists of a logistic regression of a response variable on explanatory variables and an autoregression on responses at neighboring locations on a lattice. It is a Markov random field with pairwise spatial dependence and is a popular tool for modeling spatial binary responses. In this article, we add a temporal component to the autologistic regression model for spatial-temporal binary data. The spatial-temporal autologistic regression model captures the relationship between a binary response and potential explanatory variables, and adjusts for both spatial dependence and temporal dependence simultaneously by space-time Markov random field. We estimate the model parameters by maximum pseudo-likelihood and obtain optimal prediction of future responses on the lattice by a Gibbs sampler. For illustration, the method is applied to study the outbreaks of southern pine beetle in North Carolina. We also discuss the generality of our approach for modeling other types of spatial-temporal lattice data.},

 abstract = {Gaussian random fields (GRFs) play an important part in spatial modelling, but can be computationally infeasible for general covariance structures. An efficient approach is to specify GRFs via stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and derive Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) approximations of the solutions. We consider the construction of a class of non-stationary GRFs with varying local anisotropy, where the local anisotropy is introduced by allowing the coefficients in the SPDE to vary with position. This is done by using a form of diffusion equation driven by Gaussian white noise with a spatially varying diffusion matrix. This allows for the introduction of parameters that control the GRF by parametrizing the diffusion matrix. These parameters and the GRF may be considered to be part of a hierarchical model and the parameters estimated in a Bayesian framework. The results show that the use of an SPDE with non-constant coefficients is a promising way of creating non-stationary spatial GMRFs that allow for physical interpretability of the parameters, although there are several remaining challenges that would need to be solved before these models can be put to general practical use.},

abstract = { The growing demand for spatially detailed data to advance the Sustainable Development Goals agenda of ‘leaving no one behind’ has resulted in a shift in focus from aggregate national and province-based metrics to small areas and high-resolution grids in the health and development arena. Vaccination coverage is customarily measured through aggregate-level statistics, which mask fine-scale heterogeneities and ‘coldspots’ of low coverage. This paper develops a methodology for high-resolution mapping of vaccination coverage using areal data in settings where point-referenced survey data are inaccessible. The proposed methodology is a binomial spatial regression model with a logit link and a combination of covariate data and random effects modelling two levels of spatial autocorrelation in the linear predictor. The principal aspect of the model is the melding of the misaligned areal data and the prediction grid points using the regression component and each of the conditional autoregressive and the Gaussian spatial process random effects. The Bayesian model is fitted using the INLA-SPDE approach. We demonstrate the predictive ability of the model using simulated data sets. The results obtained indicate a good predictive performance by the model, with correlations of between 0.66 and 0.98 obtained at the grid level between true and predicted values. The methodology is applied to predicting the coverage of measles and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccinations at 5 × 5 km2 in Afghanistan and Pakistan using subnational Demographic and Health Surveys data. The predicted maps are used to highlight vaccination coldspots and assess progress towards coverage targets to facilitate the implementation of more geographically precise interventions. The proposed methodology can be readily applied to wider disaggregation problems in related contexts, including mapping other health and development indicators. }

abstract = "It is widely accepted that spatial dependencies have to be acknowledged appropriately in data that are spatially aligned. However, most spatial models still assume that the dependence structure does not vary over space, i.e., it is stationary. While assuming stationarity considerably facilitates estimation, it is often too restrictive when describing atmospheric phenomena such as precipitation. Nonetheless, the applicability of non-stationary models is often hindered, as their use reveals to be cumbersome and improvements over stationary models can be hard to identify. The stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) approach to spatial modelling allows for flexible specifications of non-stationary models. In particular, given the German orographic diversity, it makes sense to investigate potential non-stationarity in precipitation patterns. Taking such potential non-stationarities into account may, in particular, leads to improved smoothing of the observed precipitation pattern taken on a finite set of measurement stations, and therefore to improved inputs to hydrological models. We suggest an SPDE-based model where the mean and dependence structure are allowed to vary with elevation, as well as a more flexible non-parametric alternative based on multivariate B-Splines. As factors such as wind may cause higher dependence in a given direction, we include anisotropy in the model. Results show that, according to the widely applicable Bayesian information criterion, a non-stationary model provides a better fit to the data. Taking German monthly precipitation as a motivation, we set up a simulation study to explore the ability of the elevation and spline-based models to correctly identify non-stationarity."

abstract = {Summary Methods based on the propensity score comprise one set of valuable tools for comparative effectiveness research and for estimating causal effects more generally. These methods typically consist of two distinct stages: (1) a propensity score stage where a model is fit to predict the propensity to receive treatment (the propensity score), and (2) an outcome stage where responses are compared in treated and untreated units having similar values of the estimated propensity score. Traditional techniques conduct estimation in these two stages separately; estimates from the first stage are treated as fixed and known for use in the second stage. Bayesian methods have natural appeal in these settings because separate likelihoods for the two stages can be combined into a single joint likelihood, with estimation of the two stages carried out simultaneously. One key feature of joint estimation in this context is “feedback” between the outcome stage and the propensity score stage, meaning that quantities in a model for the outcome contribute information to posterior distributions of quantities in the model for the propensity score. We provide a rigorous assessment of Bayesian propensity score estimation to show that model feedback can produce poor estimates of causal effects absent strategies that augment propensity score adjustment with adjustment for individual covariates. We illustrate this phenomenon with a simulation study and with a comparative effectiveness investigation of carotid artery stenting versus carotid endarterectomy among 123,286 Medicare beneficiaries hospitlized for stroke in 2006 and 2007.},

We present a Bayesian hierarchical model that incorporates time activity data to obtain an adjusted distribution of air pollution exposure for categories of individuals (group exposure); its implementation is illustrated using ambient data from five large US cities (NMMAPS database) and diaries of daily activities from the CHAD database. We then quantify the differences on the relative risks that arise when ambient concentration is used instead of time activity adjusted group exposure through a simulation study. Ambient concentrations overestimate exposures compared with those suggested using time-activity data. The overestimate is higher for ≥65 years people than younger adults. The simulation study suggests that using time activity adjusted group exposure would result in observed relative risks 1.5–2.5 times higher than those estimated on the basis of ambient concentrations."

One of the main challenges in model updating is the difficulty in distinguishing between the effects of calibration parameters versus model discrepancy. We illustrate this identifiability problem with several examples, explain the mechanisms behind it, and attempt to shed light on when a system may or may not be identifiable. In some instances, identifiability is achievable under mild assumptions, whereas in other instances, it is virtually impossible. In a companion paper, we demonstrate that using multiple responses, each of which depends on a common set of calibration parameters, can substantially enhance identifiability.}",

abstract = {Abstract Sublimation is an important hydrological flux in cold, snow-dominated ecosystems. In high-elevation spruce-fir forests of western North America, spruce beetle outbreaks have killed trees, reduced the canopy, and altered processes that control sublimation. We evaluated two hypotheses related to effects of disturbance on sublimation in this ecosystem: (1) the dominant source for sublimation is canopy intercepted snow and (2) the loss of canopy following a beetle disturbance leads to less total sublimation. To incorporate uncertainty hierarchically across multiple data sources and address phenomenological parsimony, Bayesian statistics were used to analyze 17 years (2000–2016) of winter eddy covariance flux data at the Glacier Lakes Ecosystem Experiments Sites AmeriFlux sites where a spruce beetle outbreak caused 75–85\% basal area mortality. Our analysis revealed that resistances to sublimate snow from the canopy were an order of magnitude less than from the snowpack, and the maximum snow loading capacity in disturbed canopies was reduced to 34\% of its pre-outbreak value. Total sublimation has decreased since 2010, 2 years after the main outbreak, declining 24\% (with a 95\% credible interval, C.I., between 18\% and 38\%) during 2014–2016 due to a 32\% decrease in canopy sublimation. Snowpack sublimation only increased 3\% over this period. With less total sublimation, the forest retained 6.1\% (4.5–12.3\% C.I.) more snowpack mass or equivalently 4.4\% (3.2–8.8 C.I.) of the annual precipitation. Considering tree growth and ecological succession are slow in spruce-fir forests, this decrease in sublimation should persist as an increased snowpack for decades, with substantial impacts on catchment hydrologic processes and potentially streamflow.},

The residuals describe the match (or mismatch) between the empirical distribution function and the model distribution function. If the match is high, the observation is considered to be a regular observation. But for large (in magnitude) residuals, there is a mismatch, and the corresponding likelihood score function may require downweighting in order to obtain a robust solution. As there is little or no downweighting for observations where there is no evidence of mismatch, asymptotically, we expect that there will be no downweighting under the pure model leading to highly efficient estimators. On the other hand, properly calibrated weight functions that penalize the observations with large residuals will lead to highly robust solutions under model misspecification and the presence of outliers.

abstract = {Spatial nonstationarity is a condition in which a simple model cannot explain the relationships between some sets of variables. The nature of the model must alter over space to reflect the structure within the data. In this paper, a technique is developed, termed geographically weighted regression, which attempts to capture this variation by calibrating a multiple regression model which allows different relationships to exist at different points in space. This technique is loosely based on kernel regression. The method itself is introduced and related issues such as the choice of a spatial weighting function are discussed. Following this, a series of related statistical tests are considered which can be described generally as tests for spatial nonstationarity. Using Monte Carlo methods, techniques are proposed for investigating the null hypothesis that the data may be described by a global model rather than a non-stationary one and also for testing whether individual regression coefficients are stable over geographic space. These techniques are demonstrated on a data set from the 1991 U.K. census relating car ownership rates to social class and male unemployment. The paper concludes by discussing ways in which the technique can be extended.},

In contrast, SMI allows \emph{tunable and directed} information flow between modules.We illustrate our methods on two standard test cases from the literature and a motivating archaeological data set.},

abstract = {Abstract This paper describes geographically weighted Poisson regression (GWPR) and its semi-parametric variant as a new statistical tool for analysing disease maps arising from spatially non-stationary processes. The method is a type of conditional kernel regression which uses a spatial weighting function to estimate spatial variations in Poisson regression parameters. It enables us to draw surfaces of local parameter estimates which depict spatial variations in the relationships between disease rates and socio-economic characteristics. The method therefore can be used to test the general assumption made, often without question, in the global modelling of spatial data that the processes being modelled are stationary over space. Equally, it can be used to identify parts of the study region in which ‘interesting’ relationships might be occurring and where further investigation might be warranted. Such exceptions can easily be missed in traditional global modelling and therefore GWPR provides disease analysts with an important new set of statistical tools. We demonstrate the GWPR approach applied to a dataset of working-age deaths in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan. The results indicate that there are significant spatial variations (that is, variation beyond that expected from random sampling) in the relationships between working-age mortality and occupational segregation and between working-age mortality and unemployment throughout the Tokyo metropolitan area and that, consequently, the application of traditional ‘global’ models would yield misleading results.

MCMC estimators are generally biased after any fixed number of iterations. We propose to remove this bias by using couplings of Markov chains together with a telescopic sum argument of Glynn and Rhee. The resulting unbiased estimators can be computed independently in parallel. We discuss practical couplings for popular MCMC algorithms. We establish the theoretical validity of the estimators proposed and study their efficiency relative to the underlying MCMC algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the performance and limitations of the method on toy examples, on an Ising model around its critical temperature, on a high dimensional variable-selection problem, and on an approximation of the cut distribution arising in Bayesian inference for models made of multiple modules.},

abstract = {Geographically weighted regression (GWR) has become popular in recent years to deal with spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity in forestry and ecological data. However, researchers have realized that GWR has some limitations, such as correlated model coefficients across study areas, strong influence of outliers, weak data problem, etc. In this study, we applied Bayesian geographically weighted regression (BGWR) and a robust BGWR (rBGWR) to model the relationship between tree crown and diameter using observed tree data and simulated data to investigate model fitting and performance in order to overcome some limitations of GWR. Our results indicated that, for observed tree data, the rBGWR estimated tree crown more accurate than both BGWR and GWR. For the simulated data, 74.1% of the estimated slope coefficients by rBGWR and 73.4% of the estimated slope coefficients by BGWR were not significantly different (&#945; = 0.05) from the corresponding simulated slope coefficients. The estimation of model coefficients by rBGWR was not sensitive to outliers, but the coefficient estimation by GWR was strongly affected by those outliers. The majority of the coefficient estimates by rBGWR and BGWR for weak observations were not significantly (&#945; = 0.05) different from the simulated coefficients. Therefore, BGWR (including rBGWR) may be a better alternative to overcome some limitations of GWR. In addition, both BGWR and rBGWR were more powerful than GWR to detect the spatial areas with non-constant variance or spatial outliers.},

However, these models are based on the assumption that the error (or, in some cases, the response variable) is normally distributed with constant variance and that the relations are equal throughout space. Thus, these models may not be the most appropriate to adjust spatially varying rates and proportions. The Beta Regression model deals with rates and proportions and has been shown to be a good approach to model this type of data, since it naturally adapts to variables constrained to an interval of the real line and exhibiting heteroscedasticity, which is a common characteristic in this type of data. In addition, to deal with spatial non-stationarity, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) allows for variability in the parameters by an extension of the linear regression model, providing a better understanding of the spatial phenomenon. Therefore, we propose the Geographically Weighted Beta Regression (GWBR) model which combines the features of the above models such that a better fit is provided in the study of spatially varying continuous variables restricted to an interval of the real line. We applied this model to analyze the proportion of households that have telephones in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The results were more appropriate than those obtained by the global models and the Geographically Weighted Regression model, following statistics such as AICc, pseudo-R2, log-likelihood and by the reduction of spatial dependence computed by Moran’s I."

Twenty experiments performed at relative humidities from 20\% to 80\% and 5 °C, 20 °C, or 30 °C indicated that both cold and dry conditions favor transmission. The relationship between transmission via aerosols and relative humidity at 20 °C is similar to that previously reported for the stability of influenza viruses (except at high relative humidity, 80\%), implying that the effects of humidity act largely at the level of the virus particle. For infected guinea pigs housed at 5 °C, the duration of peak shedding was approximately 40 h longer than that of animals housed at 20 °C; this increased shedding likely accounts for the enhanced transmission seen at 5 °C. To investigate the mechanism permitting prolonged viral growth, expression levels in the upper respiratory tract of several innate immune mediators were determined. Innate responses proved to be comparable between animals housed at 5 °C and 20 °C, suggesting that cold temperature (5 °C) does not impair the innate immune response in this system. Although the seasonal epidemiology of influenza is well characterized, the underlying reasons for predominant wintertime spread are not clear. We provide direct, experimental evidence to support the role of weather conditions in the dynamics of influenza and thereby address a long-standing question fundamental to the understanding of influenza epidemiology and evolution.},

	abstract = {Patterns of influenza outbreak are different in the tropics than in temperate regions. Although considerable experimental progress has been made in identifying climate-related drivers of influenza, the apparent latitudinal differences in outbreak patterns raise basic questions as to how potential environmental variables combine and act across the globe. Adopting an empirical dynamic modeling framework, we clarify that absolute humidity drives influenza outbreaks across latitudes, find that the effect of absolute humidity on influenza is U-shaped, and show that this U-shaped pattern is mediated by temperature. These findings offer a unifying synthesis that explains why experiments and analyses disagree on this relationship.In temperate countries, influenza outbreaks are well correlated to seasonal changes in temperature and absolute humidity. However, tropical countries have much weaker annual climate cycles, and outbreaks show less seasonality and are more difficult to explain with environmental correlations. Here, we use convergent cross mapping, a robust test for causality that does not require correlation, to test alternative hypotheses about the global environmental drivers of influenza outbreaks from country-level epidemic time series. By moving beyond correlation, we show that despite the apparent differences in outbreak patterns between temperate and tropical countries, absolute humidity and, to a lesser extent, temperature drive influenza outbreaks globally. We also find a hypothesized U-shaped relationship between absolute humidity and influenza that is predicted by theory and experiment, but hitherto has not been documented at the population level. The balance between positive and negative effects of absolute humidity appears to be mediated by temperature, and the analysis reveals a key threshold around 75 {\textdegree}F. The results indicate a unified explanation for environmental drivers of influenza that applies globally.},

    abstract = {Human influenza infections exhibit a strong seasonal cycle in temperate regions. Recent laboratory and epidemiological evidence suggests that low specific humidity conditions facilitate the airborne survival and transmission of the influenza virus in temperate regions, resulting in annual winter epidemics. However, this relationship is unlikely to account for the epidemiology of influenza in tropical and subtropical regions where epidemics often occur during the rainy season or transmit year-round without a well-defined season. We assessed the role of specific humidity and other local climatic variables on influenza virus seasonality by modeling epidemiological and climatic information from 78 study sites sampled globally. We substantiated that there are two types of environmental conditions associated with seasonal influenza epidemics: “cold-dry” and “humid-rainy”. For sites where monthly average specific humidity or temperature decreases below thresholds of approximately 11–12 g/kg and 18–21°C during the year, influenza activity peaks during the cold-dry season (i.e., winter) when specific humidity and temperature are at minimal levels. For sites where specific humidity and temperature do not decrease below these thresholds, seasonal influenza activity is more likely to peak in months when average precipitation totals are maximal and greater than 150 mm per month. These findings provide a simple climate-based model rooted in empirical data that accounts for the diversity of seasonal influenza patterns observed across temperate, subtropical and tropical climates.},

Station anomalies (from 1961 to 1990 means) were interpolated into 0.5° latitude/longitude grid cells covering the global land surface (excluding Antarctica), and combined with an existing climatology to obtain absolute monthly values. The dataset includes six mostly independent climate variables (mean temperature, diurnal temperature range, precipitation, wet-day frequency, vapour pressure and cloud cover). Maximum and minimum temperatures have been arithmetically derived from these. Secondary variables (frost day frequency and potential evapotranspiration) have been estimated from the six primary variables using well-known formulae. Time series for hemispheric averages and 20 large sub-continental scale regions were calculated (for mean, maximum and minimum temperature and precipitation totals) and compared to a number of similar gridded products. The new dataset compares very favourably, with the major deviations mostly in regions and/or time periods with sparser observational data. CRU TS3.10 includes diagnostics associated with each interpolated value that indicates the number of stations used in the interpolation, allowing determination of the reliability of values in an objective way. This gridded product will be publicly available, including the input station series (http://www.cru.uea.ac.uk/ and http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/data/cru/). © 2013 Royal Meteorological Society},

abstract = {In recent years, techniques have been developed to explore spatial nonstationarity and to model the entire distribution of a regressand. The former is mainly addressed by geographically weighted regression (GWR), and the latter by quantile regression (QR). However, little attention has been paid to combining these analytical techniques. The goal of this article is to fill this gap by introducing geographically weighted quantile regression (GWQR). This study briefly reviews GWR and QR, respectively, and then outlines their synergy and a new approach, GWQR. The estimations of GWQR parameters and their standard errors, the cross-validation bandwidth selection criterion, and the nonstationarity test are discussed. We apply GWQR to U.S. county data as an example, with mortality as the dependent variable and five social determinants as explanatory covariates. Maps summarize analytic results at the 5, 25, 50, 75, and 95 percentiles. We found that the associations between mortality and determinants vary not only spatially, but also simultaneously across the distribution of mortality. These new findings provide insights into the mortality literature, and are relevant to public policy and health promotion. Our GWQR approach bridges two important statistical approaches, and facilitates spatial quantile-based statistical analyses. En los últimos años se han desarrollado diversas técnicas para explorar tanto la heterocedasticidad (o no estacionariedad) espacial, así como para modelar toda la distribución de una variable dependiente. El primer tema ha sido abordado principalmente por la regresión ponderada geográficamente (Geographically Weighted Regression -GWR), y el segundo por la regresión por cuantiles (Quantile Regression-QR). La combinación de ambas técnicas analíticas, sin embargo, ha recibido mucho menos atención. El objetivo de este artículo es llenar dicho vacío mediante la propuesta de una regresión geográficamente ponderada por cuantiles (Geographically Weighted Quantile Regression- GWQR). Los autores resumen brevemente las técnicas GWR y QR respectivamente, y luego esbozan sus propiedades sinérgicas. Luego presentan la nueva técnica propuesta: GWQR. Los autores abordan los temas de las estimaciones de los parámetros GWQR y sus errores estándar, el criterio de selección del ancho de banda de la validación cruzada (cross-validation bandwidth), y la prueba heterocedasticidad espacial. Como ejemplo se aplica GWQR a datos de la tasa de mortalidad como variable dependiente y cinco determinantes sociales como variables independientes para los condados de los Estados Unidos. Los patrones espaciales se presentan en mapas con los resultados del análisis para los percentiles 5, 25, 50, 75, y 95. Los resultados muestran que las asociaciones entre la mortalidad y sus factores determinantes no sólo varían espacialmente, sino también de forma simultánea a través de la distribución de la tasa de mortalidad. Estos nuevos hallazgos coinciden con la literatura de los estudios de mortalidad, y son relevantes para aplicaciones de política pública y promoción de la salud. El enfoque GWQR representa un puente conceptual y metodológico entre dos enfoques estadísticos importantes a la vez que hace más factible el análisis estadístico espacial por cuantiles. 近年来，可用于探讨空间非平稳性和模拟回归变数分布的技术得到发展。前者主要用地理加权回归方法（GWR）处理，后者采用分位数回归（QR）处理。然而对这些分析技术的结合使用却很少关注。本文试图通过提出地理加权分位数回归（GWQR）来填补这一空白。在分别简要回顾了GWR和QR方法的基础上，基于两个方法的协同应用提出了GWQR新方法，进而讨论了GWQR的参数估计、标准误差、带宽选择标准的交叉验证和非平稳性检验。本文将死亡率作为因变量及五个社会因子作为解释变量，进行了美国县域单元的案例研究，绘制了0.05、0.25、0.5、0.75和0.95不同百分位点的分析结果图。研究发现，死亡人数不仅与解释变量的空间分布相关，同时也与其地理分布相关。这些新发现不仅可促进对死亡率相关成果的深入分析，同时也与公共政策和健康促进有关。GWQR方法架构了QR和GWR两种重要统计方法之间的纽带，也促进了基于分位数的空间统计分析方法的发展。},

abstract = {Spatially varying coefficient models are a classical tool to explore the spatial nonstationarity of a regression relationship for spatial data. In this paper, we study the estimation and inference in spatially varying coefficient models for data distributed over complex domains. We use bivariate splines over triangulations to represent the coefficient functions. The estimators of the coefficient functions are consistent, and rates of convergence of the proposed estimators are established. A penalized bivariate spline estimation method is also introduced, in which a roughness penalty is incorporated to balance the goodness of fit and smoothness. In addition, we propose hypothesis tests to examine if the coefficient function is really varying over space or admits a certain parametric form. The proposed method is much more computationally efficient than the well-known geographically weighted regression technique and thus usable for analyzing massive data sets. The performances of the estimators and the proposed tests are evaluated by simulation experiments. An environmental data example is used to illustrate the application of the proposed method.},

abstract = {Summary. Problems associated with the analysis of data from a mixture of distributions include the presence of outliers in the sample, the fact that a component may not be well represented in the data, and the problem of biases that occur when the model is slightly misspecified. We study the performance of weighted likelihood in this context. The method produces estimates with low bias and mean squared error, and it is useful in that it unearths data substructures in the form of multiple roots. This in turn indicates multiple potential mixture model fits due to the presence of more components than originally specified in the model. To compute the weighted likelihood estimates, we use as starting values the method of moment estimates computed on bootstrap subsamples drawn from the data. We address a number of important practical issues involving bootstrap sample size selection, the role of starting values, and the behavior of the roots. The algorithm used to compute the weighted likelihood estimates is competitive with EM, and it is similar to EM when the components are not well separated. Moreover, we propose a new statistical stopping rule for the termination of the algorithm. An example and a small simulation study illustrate the above points.},

abstract = {Summary We propose a framework for general Bayesian inference. We argue that a valid update of a prior belief distribution to a posterior can be made for parameters which are connected to observations through a loss function rather than the traditional likelihood function, which is recovered as a special case. Modern application areas make it increasingly challenging for Bayesians to attempt to model the true data-generating mechanism. For instance, when the object of interest is low dimensional, such as a mean or median, it is cumbersome to have to achieve this via a complete model for the whole data distribution. More importantly, there are settings where the parameter of interest does not directly index a family of density functions and thus the Bayesian approach to learning about such parameters is currently regarded as problematic. Our framework uses loss functions to connect information in the data to functionals of interest. The updating of beliefs then follows from a decision theoretic approach involving cumulative loss functions. Importantly, the procedure coincides with Bayesian updating when a true likelihood is known yet provides coherent subjective inference in much more general settings. Connections to other inference frameworks are highlighted.},

However, this is typically a difficult task since it amounts to integrating over all model parameters. The aim of the paper is to illustrate how this may be achieved by using ideas from thermodynamic integration or path sampling. We show how the marginal likelihood can be computed via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods on modified posterior distributions for each model. This then allows Bayes factors or posterior model probabilities to be calculated. We show that this approach requires very little tuning and is straightforward to implement. The new method is illustrated in a variety of challenging statistical settings.},

The approach generates an alternative to classical extremum estimation and also falls outside the parametric Bayesian approach. For example, it offers a new attractive estimation method for such important semi-parametric problems as censored and instrumental quantile regression, nonlinear GMM and value-at-risk models. The LTEs are computed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, which help circumvent the computational curse of dimensionality. A large sample theory is obtained and illustrated for regular cases."

abstract = {Summary.  With scientific data available at geocoded locations, investigators are increasingly turning to spatial process models for carrying out statistical inference. Over the last decade, hierarchical models implemented through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods have become especially popular for spatial modelling, given their flexibility and power to fit models that would be infeasible with classical methods as well as their avoidance of possibly inappropriate asymptotics. However, fitting hierarchical spatial models often involves expensive matrix decompositions whose computational complexity increases in cubic order with the number of spatial locations, rendering such models infeasible for large spatial data sets. This computational burden is exacerbated in multivariate settings with several spatially dependent response variables. It is also aggravated when data are collected at frequent time points and spatiotemporal process models are used. With regard to this challenge, our contribution is to work with what we call predictive process models for spatial and spatiotemporal data. Every spatial (or spatiotemporal) process induces a predictive process model (in fact, arbitrarily many of them). The latter models project process realizations of the former to a lower dimensional subspace, thereby reducing the computational burden. Hence, we achieve the flexibility to accommodate non-stationary, non-Gaussian, possibly multivariate, possibly spatiotemporal processes in the context of large data sets. We discuss attractive theoretical properties of these predictive processes. We also provide a computational template encompassing these diverse settings. Finally, we illustrate the approach with simulated and real data sets.},

abstract = {Summary Physical activity has many well-documented health benefits for cardiovascular fitness and weight control. For pregnant women, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists currently recommends 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most, if not all, days; however, very few pregnant women achieve this level of activity. Traditionally, studies have focused on examining individual or interpersonal factors to identify predictors of physical activity. There is a renewed interest in whether characteristics of the physical environment in which we live and work may also influence physical activity levels. We consider one of the first studies of pregnant women that examines the impact of characteristics of the built environment on physical activity levels. Using a socioecologic framework, we study the associations between physical activity and several factors including personal characteristics, meteorological/air quality variables, and neighborhood characteristics for pregnant women in four counties of North Carolina. We simultaneously analyze six types of physical activity and investigate cross-dependencies between these activity types. Exploratory analysis suggests that the associations are different in different regions. Therefore, we use a multivariate regression model with spatially varying regression coefficients. This model includes a regression parameter for each covariate at each spatial location. For our data with many predictors, some form of dimension reduction is clearly needed. We introduce a Bayesian variable selection procedure to identify subsets of important variables. Our stochastic search algorithm determines the probabilities that each covariate's effect is null, non-null but constant across space, and spatially varying. We found that individual-level covariates had a greater influence on women's activity levels than neighborhood environmental characteristics, and some individual-level covariates had spatially varying associations with the activity levels of pregnant women.},

abstract = {Geographically weighted regression (GWR) is a local spatial regression technique to model varying relationships in many application domains, such as ecology, environmental management, public health, meteorology, and tourism. In the literature, most of the studies dealing with GWR do not take into account if the dataset is frequently updated and so these techniques are not efficient to handle such datasets. In this study, to handle frequently updated data on given locations, a computationally efficient GWR approach, RNN-GWR, which utilizes reverse nearest neighbor (RNN) strategy, is proposed. The performance of the proposed RNN-GWR approach is compared with the performances of a Naïve-GWR and FastGWR approaches. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed approach is computationally efficient than the other approaches on handling frequently updated data.}

ABSTRACT = {The commonly used Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) fitting method for a spatial varying coefficient model is to select a bandwidth h for the geographic location (u, v), and assign the same weight to the two dimensions. However, spatial data usually present anisotropy. The introduction of a two-dimensional bandwidth matrix not only gives weight from two dimensions separately, but also increases the direction of kernel smoothness. The adaptive bandwidth matrix is more flexible. Therefore, in this paper, a two dimensional bandwidth matrix is introduced into the spatial varying coefficient model for parameter estimation. Through simulation experiments, the results obtained under the adaptive bandwidth matrix are compared with those obtained under the global bandwidth matrix, indicating the effectiveness of introducing the adaptive bandwidth matrix.},

    abstract = { The most prevalent spatial data setting is, arguably, that of so-called geostatistical data, data that arise as random variables observed at fixed spatial locations. Collection of such data in space and in time has grown enormously in the past two decades. With it has grown a substantial array of methods to analyze such data. Here, we attempt a review of a fully model-based perspective for such data analysis, the approach of hierarchical modeling fitted within a Bayesian framework. The benefit, as with hierarchical Bayesian modeling in general, is full and exact inference, with proper assessment of uncertainty. Geostatistical modeling includes univariate and multivariate data collection at sites, continuous and categorical data at sites, static and dynamic data at sites, and datasets over very large numbers of sites and long periods of time. Within the hierarchical modeling framework, we offer a review of the current state of the art in these settings. }

Our results indicated that (i) the GWR models with smaller bandwidths fit the data better, yielded smaller model residuals across tree sizes, significantly reduced spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity for model residuals, and generated better spatial patterns for model residuals; however, smaller bandwidth sizes produced a high level of coefficient variability; (ii) the GWR models based on the fixed spatial kernel function produced smoother spatial distributions for the model coefficients than those based on the adaptive kernel function; and (iii) the GWR cross-validation or Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) optimization process may not produce an “optimal” bandwidth for model fitting and performance. It was evident that the selection of spatial kernel function and bandwidth has a strong impact on the descriptive and predictive power of GWR models. }

With respect to model calibration, parameter estimation and analysis of uncertainty sources, various regression and probabilistic approaches are used in hydrological modeling. A family of Bayesian methods, which incorporates different sources of information into a single analysis through Bayes’ theorem, is widely used for uncertainty assessment. However, none of these approaches can well treat the impact of high flows in hydrological modeling. This study proposes a Bayesian modularization uncertainty assessment approach in which the highest streamflow observations are treated as suspect information that should not influence the inference of the main bulk of the model parameters. This study includes a comprehensive comparison and evaluation of uncertainty assessments by our new Bayesian modularization method and standard Bayesian methods using the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm with the daily hydrological model WASMOD. Three likelihood functions were used in combination with standard Bayesian method: the AR(1) plus Normal model independent of time (Model 1), the AR(1) plus Normal model dependent on time (Model 2) and the AR(1) plus Multi-normal model (Model 3). The results reveal that the Bayesian modularization method provides the most accurate streamflow estimates measured by the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and provide the best in uncertainty estimates for low, medium and entire flows compared to standard Bayesian methods. The study thus provides a new approach for reducing the impact of high flows on the discharge uncertainty assessment of hydrological models via Bayesian method.}

However, these models have often been found to be sensitive to the model parameterization, as well as the specifics of the data set used. The Bayesian salmonella source attribution model presented here was developed to be generally applicable with small and sparse annual data sets obtained over several years. The full Bayesian model was modularized into three parts (an exposure model, a subtype distribution model, and an epidemiological model) in order to separately estimate unknown parameters in each module. The proposed model takes advantage of the consumption and overall salmonella prevalence of the studied sources, as well as bacteria typing results from adjacent years. The latter were used for a smoothed estimation of the annual relative proportions of different salmonella subtypes in each of the sources. The source-specific effects and the salmonella subtype-specific effects were included in the epidemiological model to describe the differences between sources and between subtypes in their ability to infect humans. The estimation of these parameters was based on data from multiple years. Finally, the model combines the total evidence from different modules to proportion human salmonellosis cases according to their sources. The model was applied to allocate reported human salmonellosis cases from the years 2008 to 2015 to eight food sources.},

To this end, a novel hierarchical Bayesian modelling framework was developed in which a latent, pixel-level incidence surface with spatio-temporal innovations is linked to the observed case data via a flexible catchment sub-model designed to account for the absence of data on case household locations. These maps have focussed the delivery of indoor residual spraying and focal mass drug administration in the Grand’Anse Department in South-Western Haiti.},

abstract = {In subalpine forests where snowpacks can persist for 50% of the year or longer, wintertime subnivean soil respiration constitutes a significant, but poorly understood, portion of the carbon (C) cycle. The temporal and seasonal dynamics of this flux are difficult to measure compared to snow-free respiration. This makes it challenging to fully address key knowledge gaps in high-elevation forests, including effects of tree mortality on ecosystem C fluxes. Our paper attempts to overcome these challenges by developing a new method for estimating wintertime CO2 flux from soil underneath winter snowpack based on CO2 profiles in the snow and using this to examine potential effects of a tree mortality event on wintertime respiration. The chief problem for estimates based on snow CO2 measurements is that during strong winds, vertical CO2 profiles can depart significantly from linearity, resulting in CO2 fluxes that are not steady-state diffusive fluxes. Consequently, these fluxes include an advective component induced by wind and atmospheric pressure, resulting in above-snowpack fluxes that may be temporally decoupled from biological flux production in the soil. These advective fluxes lead to errors in estimates of the total amount of CO2 produced from the soil surface during the winter, and may complicate the detection of significant seasonal and interannual trends in snowpack CO2 fluxes. Our goal was twofold: first, to improve methods for estimating wintertime subnivean soil respiration; and second, to use this new method to examine potential effects of forest mortality on respiration. We develop a Bayesian-based model of CO2 snowpack profiles and accounts for CO2 storage flux within the snowpack to calculate diffusive and advective fluxes from both the bottom and the top of the snowpack. We apply this model to hourly snowpack CO2 profile data collected over 7 years at an AmeriFlux eddy covariance (EC) site in a Wyoming subalpine forest that had recently experienced a mass tree mortality event. Hourly advective fluxes from the snowpack surface are less variable over time than hourly EC fluxes. Nonetheless, on a daily time scale, the two methods agree well with each other. We found that soil biological CO2 production entering the bottom of snowpack peaked 3 years after the onset of the bark beetle outbreak and 1-year after dead trees dropped their needles, presenting the first evidence of a short-term increase in respiration following bark beetle mortality. Our findings emphasize the importance of accounting for the role of wind-driven advection in wintertime respiration and suggest that tree mortality may nearly double wintertime respiration in the first few years.}

This article considers how uncertainty associated with the design stage impacts estimation of causal effects in the analysis stage. Such design uncertainty can derive from the fact that the PS itself is an estimated quantity, but also from other features of the design stage tied to choice of PS implementation. This article offers a procedure for obtaining the posterior distribution of causal effects after marginalizing over a distribution of design-stage outputs, lending a degree of formality to Bayesian methods for PSA that have gained attention in recent literature. Formulation of a probability distribution for the design-stage output depends on how the PS is implemented in the design stage, and propagation of uncertainty into causal estimates depends on how the treatment effect is estimated in the analysis stage. We explore these differences within a sample of commonly used PS implementations (quantile stratification, nearest-neighbor matching, caliper matching, inverse probability of treatment weighting, and doubly robust estimation) and investigate in a simulation study the impact of statistician choice in PS model and implementation on the degree of between- and within-design variability in the estimated treatment effect. The methods are then deployed in an investigation of the association between levels of fine particulate air pollution and elevated exposure to emissions from coal-fired power plants.},
