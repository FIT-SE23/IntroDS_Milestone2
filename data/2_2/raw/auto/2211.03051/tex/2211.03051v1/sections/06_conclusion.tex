\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we show that the classification of zebrafish by genotype using a shallow neural network trained on two-dimensional behaviour features is feasible. The proposed model architecture shows an average 84\% accuracy. Correct initialisation of the network, paired with methods for combatting overfitting such as dropout, tuning the batch size, and optimisation of learning parameters, allowed for successful training of these models.

The integrated gradients of these models provide a way of analysing the impact of behavioural features with respect to its predictive output. The attribution scores can be used to remove low-scoring features that are more likely to confuse the model during training rather than assist with correct label predictions.
