	abstract = {The analysis of highway-crash data has long been used as a basis for influencing highway and vehicle designs, as well as directing and implementing a wide variety of regulatory policies aimed at improving safety. And, over time there has been a steady improvement in statistical methodologies that have enabled safety researchers to extract more information from crash databases to guide a wide array of safety design and policy improvements. In spite of the progress made over the years, important methodological barriers remain in the statistical analysis of crash data and this, along with the availability of many new data sources, present safety researchers with formidable future challenges, but also exciting future opportunities. This paper provides guidance in defining these challenges and opportunities by first reviewing the evolution of methodological applications and available data in highway-accident research. Based on this review, fruitful directions for future methodological developments are identified and the role that new data sources will play in defining these directions is discussed. It is shown that new methodologies that address complex issues relating to unobserved heterogeneity, endogeneity, risk compensation, spatial and temporal correlations, and more, have the potential to significantly expand our understanding of the many factors that affect the likelihood and severity (in terms of personal injury) of highway crashes. This in turn can lead to more effective safety countermeasures that can substantially reduce highway-related injuries and fatalities.},

	title = {Integrating safety into the fundamental relations of freeway traffic flows: A conflict-based safety assessment framework},
	volume = {32},
	issn = {2213-6657},
	abstract = {Numerous statistical and data-driven modeling frameworks have estimated rear-end crashes and crash-prone events from macroscopic traffic states which are at the heart of traffic flow modelling and control. However, existing frameworks focus on critical events and exclude a vast majority of safer interactions, which are essential information with respect to identifying the trade-offs between congestion management and rear-end crash prevention. This study proposes a flexible conflict-based framework to extract safety information from freeway macroscopic traffic state variables (i.e., speed and density) by utilizing the information from all underlying car-following interactions. Time spent in conflict ({TSC}) is introduced as the total time spent by all vehicles in rear-end conflicts based on a given conflict measure and a threshold to be determined flexibly. Using the {NGSIM} vehicle trajectory dataset, we show that the proportion of stopping distance ({PSD}) is more desirable than several event-based conflict measures (e.g., time to collision) for describing {TSC} based on macroscopic state variables. Besides, it is shown that {PSD} provides explicit safety information about the entire travel time for each macroscopic state because it applies to all car-following interactions. This paper proposes a hybrid methodological framework combining probabilistic and machine learning models to develop the relationships between safety and macroscopic state variables within a flexible conflict-based safety assessment framework. At first, probabilistic and Machine learning models are separately developed to estimate {PSD}-based {TSC} using only macroscopic stte variables. Each approach is evaluated comprehensively against empirical observations using the {NGSIM} vehicle trajectory dataset. While the machine learning approach has better predictive accuracy for a fixed rear-end conflict threshold (i.e., {PSDcr}), the probabilistic approach has a better explaining capability and captures {TSC} using flexible conflict thresholds. Utilizing the advantages of these two approaches, the proposed hybrid framework satisfactorily predicts {TSC} corresponding to {PSD}{\textless}{PSDcr} for a wide range of thresholds based only on macroscopic state variables. This paper provides an endogenous safety dimension to the fundamental relations of freeway traffic flows that can be utilized to balance freeway traffic flow efficiency and safety. For instance, control studies can utilize the proposed framework to minimize total travel time while also minimizing total time spent in conflict for crash-prone situations such as shockwaves and traffic oscillations.},

	abstract = {Urban midblock crashes are influenced mainly by traffic operation and roadway geometric features. In this paper, 10-year crash data from 1,506 directional urban midblock segments in Nebraska were analyzed using the multivariate random parameters zero-inflated negative binomial model to account for unobserved heterogeneity produced by correlations across segments, correlations across crash collision types, excessive zero crashes, and over dispersion. The multivariate random parameters zero-inflated negative binomial model was superior to many common crash frequency models in terms of both goodness of fit and prediction accuracy. Compared with the multivariate fixed parameters zero-inflated negative binomial model, the multivariate random parameters zero-inflated negative binomial model identified fewer key influencing factors and revealed segment-specific effects of these factors on different crash types. It showed that the number of lanes, annual average daily traffic per lane, and segment length might have non-positive effects on crash frequencies. Segments with a speed limit of 45 mph had fewer crashes than did those with lower speed limits, and there were fewer crashes on the segments in Omaha than on those in Lincoln. It was also found that neither the presence of a shoulder, on-street parking, or one-way traffic, nor lane width had significant influences on crash frequencies. These findings are informative for transportation agencies to take correct and efficient measures to accommodate diverse transportation demands without reducing traffic safety. By contrast, the fixed parameters model produced results consistent with intuition, but the results were insufficient to provide actionable recommendations.},

	issn = {2213-6657},
	abstract = {Real-time safety analysis and optimization using surrogate safety measures such as traffic conflicts and techniques such extreme value theory ({EVT}) models is an emerging research topic in the context of proactive traffic safety management. However, the predictive performance and temporal transferability of the existing real-time safety analysis {EVT} models are subject to the assumption of invariant model parameters, which do not account for the temporal variability and is not suitable for real-time traffic data analysis. This study proposes a Bayesian dynamic extreme value modeling approach for conflict-based real-time safety analysis which integrates a Bayesian dynamic linear model with the extreme value distribution. The proposed approach has several unique advantages as it: 1) allows the model parameters to be time-varying; 2) integrates the newer data with prior information to recursively update the model parameters and account for state-space changes and react to sudden trend changes; 3) accounts for temporal variability and non-stationarity in conflict extremes; and 4) quantitatively evaluates the real-time safety levels of a road facility. The proposed approach is applied for cycle-by-cycle safety analysis at four signalized intersections in the city of Surrey, British Columbia. Traffic conflicts are characterized by the modified time to collision indicator. Three traffic parameters (traffic volume, shock wave area, and platoon ratio) at the signal cycle level are considered as covariates to account for non-stationarity. Several Bayesian dynamic and static extreme value models are developed and two safety indices, namely risk of crash ({RC}) and return level ({RL}), are generated to quantitatively represent the cycle-level safety. The {RC} directly reflects whether a cycle is risky while the {RL} can evaluate the safety levels of individual cycles. The results show that the dynamic model can identify more crash-risk cycles with either a positive {RC} or a positive {RL} than the static model and is more capable of differentiating the safety levels for individual cycles in terms of {RL}. Overall, the dynamic model outperforms the static model in terms of the statistical fit and aggregate crash estimation accuracy.},
