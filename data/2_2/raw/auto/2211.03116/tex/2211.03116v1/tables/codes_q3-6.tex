\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
Categories/codes & \# & Example quotes\\
\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\textbf{Code} & \textbf{33} &  \\
Modules & 18 & ``Self adaptation mechanisms used for speech recognition ... are also used for computer assisted coding solutions. ''; ``Different parts of the Behavior tree can be reused in different robots.''\\
Scripts and algorithms & 8 & ``The same scripts and solutions are constantly reused - because it’s the easiest way to create new with a constant lack of time.''; ``Threshold algorithms are reused frequently, with the threshold value adapted for the specific use case.''  \\
Libraries & 7 & ``internal libraries that simplify monitoring, interaction with external tools, etc''
\\\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\textbf{Design artifacts} & \textbf{22}
\\
Patterns & 7 & ``We try to reuse design patterns (e.g. autoscaling) for all cloud native applications we build.''; ``Re-use of design patterns like MAPE-K. ''\\
Architecture & 7 & ``AWS stack\,...\,can be used as a generic template cross different applications which are based on a job processing ''\\
Know-how & 5 & ``We use similar principles in different product.''; ``We reused knowledge of driver parameter adaptation from FDM (3 axis) printer while designing a SLA (single axis) printer.''\\
Models & 3 & ``machine learning cost models can be reused by different systems''
\\\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\textbf{Specifications} & \textbf{18}
\\
Policies \& rules & 5 & ``auto-scaling policies ... have a standard definition which can be reused in different systems or use-cases.''\\
Configuration files & 5 & ``K8s config files for different cloud native application can be similar''\\
Templates & 4 & ``We reuse very similar set of configuration templates of container deployment''\\
Metrics & 4 & ``Kibana alerts''
\\\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\textbf{IT infrastructure} & \textbf{11}
\\
Frameworks\,\&\,platforms & 7 & ``a framework for monitoring metrics that allows labels to be given to properties, the time-series data to be tracked in a database, and then hooks to visualization database and alert systems.''\\
Tools & 4 & ``Use the same tools AWS provides for all our different product deployments.''
\\\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\textbf{Procedures} & \textbf{7}
\\
Processes & 3 & ``Writing "watchdog" processes for systems that aren't deployed to kubernetes''\\
Pipelines & 2 & ``pipeline (Application\,-\,Datadog\,-\,custom logic\,-\,AWS API) is replicated with different settings for different use-cases.''\\
Schedules & 2 & ``Most of the approaches we use for digital twins share some history ... An example of that is in the scheduling space, where schedules need to adapt to changes in resources or the inclusion and removal of tasks.''\\
