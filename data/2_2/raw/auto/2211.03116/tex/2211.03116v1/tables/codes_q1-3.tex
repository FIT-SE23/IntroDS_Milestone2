\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
Categories/codes & \# & Example quotes\\
\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\textbf{Improved utility} & \textbf{61} & \\
Robustness & 21 & ``fault tolerance, one node dies, a new one is spawned without manual intervention''; ``better error handling and prompt disaster recovery'' \\
Performance & 16 & ``Improve performance and quality-of-service''; ``increase in the speed of adaptation''  \\
Availability & 8 & ``The main benefit for us is the 99.9999\% availability, which is crucial for some customers of these cloud-specific solutions''\\
Other & 16 & ``for IoT: optimized operations, improved energy usage''; ``an important part to guarantee the safety [...] of the overall system.''\\\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\textbf{Savings} & \textbf{38} & \\
Costs & 25 & ``The primary benefit is cost reduction''; ``the cheaper bills for running this in an efficient manner in e.g. a cloud service''\\
Resources & 13 & ``scales down resources during hours when traffic is low, and scales up during peak hours, without any manual interference.''\\\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\textbf{Improved human interaction}  & \textbf{37} & \\
User experience & 19 & ``Keep Telco network in optimal condition so that QoS and user experience is maximized, and churn minimized''; ``better user satisfaction because of prompt website responses''\\
Engineers support & 18 & ``removes most of the optimization burden from programmers, so they can be more productive''; ``Reduce workload on human operators; make (the results of) certain actions [...] repeatable and predictable''\\\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\textbf{Handle dynamics} & \textbf{22} & \\
Load dynamics & 12 & ``Change AGV behavior depending of the workload with the goal to save energy (battery life).''\\
Context dynamics & 10 & ``Each machine is unique and its optimal operational parameters change over time due to ware, location, task and seasonal factor.''\\\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\textbf{Other improvements}
& \textbf{16} & \\
Various & 16 & ``In case of spikes in incoming events the system is able to adapt [...] avoiding bottlenecks.''; ``Easier and faster market integration''; ``It's fundamental in huge infrastructure systems otherwise we can’t make it happen.''\\
