\textbf{Reuse hurdles} & \textbf{19} &  \\
Different problems & 11 & ``In my case every self-tuning problem is different and prevents easy reuse.''; ``Our applications and application domains are very different and since we do research we actively look for new and different challenges.''\\
Lack of experience/maturity & 4 & ``I think lack of competence is a huge thing to overcome, though most of the organisations around us try to catch up '' \\
System structure & 2 & ``The solutions were too coupled, too integrated and not enough modularized.''\\
Organisational concerns & 2 & ``We have to go through a legal department in order to reuse code from outside ... That poses a large problem. ''\\
