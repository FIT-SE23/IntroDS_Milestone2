\textbf{Monitoring metric} & \textbf{75} &  \\

Resource usage & 23 & ``Active sessions counting, resource utilisation (e.g. RAM) monitoring given by VM''; ``Typically CPU and Memory usage''; ``Helsim: uses CPU counters to measure time or power consumption to process particles''\\

Load & 18 & ``Number of incoming HTTP requests''; ``The system polls the queue of the Spark job scheduler in our cluster every 5 seconds via REST API, using a NiFi flow.''; ``Number of queries''; ``number of requests''\\

Reliability metrics & 13 & ``AWS lambda error metric is monitored to see if the sum of 400/500 errors for every part 5 mins is less than some specified amount.''
%; ``Generic Q: Monitoring is typically done using health endpoints that should preferably not only answer back with a static `Ok', but rather either do some tests or present metrics. It may for example check the rate of failures of incoming requests. Another possibility that is commonly used is to monitor the process state, i.e. to detect dying processes.'' 
\\

Performance metrics & 12 & ``We track the response times for the users' requests.''; ``monitored systems implement specific features to provide data about their performance.'' \\

Application state & 9 & ``Tracking properties are - correct integrity - functionality of memorries (RAM, ROM), correct values and integrity of data among redundant parts.'' 
\\\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\textbf{Monitoring mechanism} & \textbf{20} &  \\
Environment sensors & 9 & ``Based on external information (external sensors like Lidar, Camera, GPS, ...) making sure no accident were to happen''; ``Exteroceptive are aggregated to create a snapshot of the world's state. These are LIDAR and Image sensors. We use Proprioceptive sensors to determine the robot's state. These are encoders only.'' \\

Logging mechanisms & 6 & ``Logging software triggered whenever an incoming request is made''; ``The system logs all interactions, both errors and successful operations.''\\

System sensors & 4 & ``Based on internal information (internal sensors like Wheel speed, steering angle, yaw and roll sensors, ...) optimize the performance to support the driver to drive optimal.''\\

Humans & 1 & ``Human review decisions are used to monitor the precision of models.''
\\\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\textbf{Monitoring tool} & \textbf{34} &  \\

Kubernetes monitoring & 9 & ``Kubernetes clusters are made out of master and worker machine nodes. On the worker nodes runs a process called kubelet that monitors the state of the worker nodes in the Kubernetes cluster''; ``Probes implemented in the application, metrics provided by K8s metrics server (goes down to cgroups via kubelet)'' \\

Prometheus & 9 & ``- every service exposes a defined set of metrics. We collect metrics regarding every layer of the distributed system. We mainly use Prometheus and Splunk to collect these metrics.''; ``Prometheus and grafana for monitoring health of services'' \\

AWS monitoring & 8 & ``We use AWS CloudWatch service to monitor and act on any event with ServerLess AWS lambda functions.''; ``AWS Lambda based monitor which monitor aprox number of message in SQS queue'' \\

Other: Azure monitoring, Datadog, Splunk, cAdvisor, Elasticsearch & 8 & ``Default tooling from Azure / AWS in combination with splunk''; ``We are using Datadog to collect relevant metrics.''; ``AKS monitors the system load and response time to start-up more instances. It also checks for malfunctioning applications and restarts them when stalled, providing high availability.'' \\
