\textbf{Stakeholder-centered techniques} & \textbf{25} &  \\

Rigorous design and development & 8 & ``careful engineering so that there are open doors for manual intervention, when necessary, without lost of system availability nor hindering the automation mechanisms''; ``We try to have design sessions [...] and possibly enhance the design in the early phases of development''; ``Engineering analysis, testing, controlled deployment, ...'' \\
 
Code review & 4 & ``As always, planning, design reviews, code reviews, testing on several levels, monitoring the production.''; ``Each incident is taken into consideration and rules are always reviewed. '' \\
 
Human supervision & 4 & ``The responsibility was left to a human operator.''; ``Mainly by performing tests and human supervision (monitoring resource utilization)'' \\
  
Outsource & 3 & ``Outsource the cloud operation to a specialized provider (RedHat, AWS) where possible. In other cases, customers had to hire experienced administrators/go through extensive period of testing to gain the necessary experience.'' \\

Other (post mortem analysis, hiring experts, work in pairs, documentation) & 6 & ``When we hit a problem years after the fact, we perform a detailed post-mortem and try to think about other possible failures we may have missed.''; ``We hired (multiple) external consultancy firms to tap into their experience in deploying such a system.''; ``Work in pairs,
Document architectural decisions'' \\
\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\textbf{Offline techniques} & \textbf{18} &  \\

Extensive testing & 15 & ``test each action in isolation before it is provided to the system''; ``Automated and human testing. In addition for complex algorithms, we run parallel, correlated analysis.''; ``With automated and manual testing while injecting non-determinism to the test suite''; ``Extensive testing at the customers factory and fine tuning of the models.'' \\
 
Set operational boundaries & 2 & ``Defined max-amount of resources a system functionality/component is allowed to consume.''; ``Thresholds and some manual monitoring'' \\
 
Encryption  & 1 & ``State of the art encryption, encryption, and encryption.'' \\
\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\textbf{Online techniques} & \textbf{9} &  \\

Runtime monitoring and analysis & 6 & ``Alerts tracking high-level properties that can give us some assurance that the system is working fine.''; ``Monitor / review the automated actions.'' \\
 
Roll-out/roll-back strategies & 2 & ``Slow roll - only send the new system traffic in small increments (10\%, 20\%, ...) until production baselines are established for load, actual latency, etc.  This helped us determine what the MIN and MAX pod settings should be as well as VM heap sizes.''; ``Manual roll back to previous stable state of user profiles.'' \\
 
Run in non-business critical hours & 1 & ``We run our processes during the night, when there is less chance of interference with business critical (customer facing) systems.'' \\
