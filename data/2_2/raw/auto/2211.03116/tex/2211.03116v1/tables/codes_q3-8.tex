\textbf{Testing and verification}  & \textbf{71} &  \\

Extensive testing & 58 & ``We use extensive testing (unit, module, system)''; ``We have extensive testing on test k8s clusters, provisioned for these purposes. ''; ``We have countless amount of testing and verification code built as part of the OpenJDK to ensure the quality of the product is appropriate. ''\\

Benchmarking & 10 & `As a lot of the self adaptation logic involves optimization opportunities, we also regularly run many benchmarks and immediately report regressions''; ``We do testing of the machine learing models, but we also have pilot factories where we test our methods and design to see if all station perform as itended.'' \\

Verification & 3 & ``expert testing, supervision, verification when applicable''; ``Testing, but also some human verification as part of the Cloud Operations team.''
\\
\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\textbf{Stakeholder-centred techniques} & \textbf{45} &  \\

Human supervision & 22 & ``Human supervision until confident.''; ``Extensive system testing and gradual release of human supervision levels upon system going live.'' \\

Rigorous design and development & 10 & ``''; ``virtual training to ensure operators understand and are comfortable with the conditions in which the safety system will engage.'' \\

Trust in third-party software & 8 & ``for features like auto-scaling compute ... we use trusted vendors and deploy these features mainly for analytics use cases which are not business-critical.'' \\

Operational constraints & 5 & ``the concrete actions that are taken by the system are defined by the user. so there is never a surprise. the system only decides if and when to apply these actions.''; ``Our autotuning algorithms never fail for particular (exactly specified) set of systems. If the system fulfils these assumptions, it works always.'' 
\\
\noalign{\smallskip}\hline\noalign{\smallskip}
\textbf{Online techniques} & \textbf{36} &  \\

Runtime monitoring and alerting & 27 & ``In cases where an existing system is not being replaced but rather new capability is being added, results will be tracked over time to ensure accuracy.''; ``we have deployed some alert to track the high-level properties of the system.'' \\

Continuous testing during operation & 6 & ``there is gradual canary testing in the real production system. ''; ``Automated test scripts, automated "synthetic transactions" in production, model performance validation'' \\

Mitigation strategies & 3 & ``This automation can provide alter with all the steps and rollback automatically if there is any issue. '' \\
