\subsection{Demographic Information}
\label{subsec:demographic_information}
%
In total, 184 participants completed the survey from 355 invitations, i.e., a response rate of 51.8\%. 
%
Based on the answers to the first question (Q0.1), we split the answers of the other questions of the demographics in two groups: those provided by all participants and those provided by participants that worked with concrete self-adaptive systems.\footnote{While we selected participants that have the required expertise to answer questions (second criterion in Section\,\ref{subsec:population_sampling}),  this does not necessarily mean that they have worked (or are working) with concrete self-adaptive systems.}  


%\begin{itemize}
\subsubsection{Experience with self-adaptation (Q0.1):} Of the 184 participants that provided valid data, 100 (54.4\%) expressed to have worked with concrete self-adaptive systems.
%\footnote{The data of the participant that was excluded also worked with concrete self-adaptive systems, yet, that data was not useful.} 
\subsubsection{Software systems built by organisations (Q0.2):} Almost all participants (181, 98.4\%) provided a valid description of the kind of systems they build. 
Based on the analysis of the data we could classify the answers along two axes: the \textit{types} of software systems built by the organisations, and the \textit{focus} of the software systems. The type refers to the domain, while the focus refers to the activities on which the organisation concentrates within the domain. For example, automation (focus) within manufacturing (type). Note that the domain may be abstract, e.g., embedded systems or communication and networks. Focus on the other hand may refer to purpose, such as analytics, but also specific technologies or methods, such as machine learning. 

Figure~\ref{tab:q1-1-types}\footnote{Because the number of participants that worked with self-adaptive systems is 100 and all provided a valid description, the absolute numbers are also percentages. We also apply this to the data of the other questions unless differently stated.} summarises the types of systems we identified. The most frequent types are web/mobile, embedded, cyber-physical, IoT systems, data management, and cloud (together these four types represent 52.5\% of all systems). Sixteen participants (8.8\%) built various types of systems.\footnote{The option ''Various'' refers to different kind of systems. The option ''Others'' on the other hand refers to specific types of systems different from those listed in the table, e.g., a system for grading software at educational institutions.} The results show that the percentages of the types of systems of all participants and those that worked with self-adaptation are similar. 

In addition to the types of systems, 104 participants (56.5\%) also provided insights in the focus of the systems they build. Among the 100 participants that worked with self-adaptation, 60 provided a description of the focus. 
%Table~\ref{tab:contingency_q1-1-focus} 
Figure~\ref{tab:q1-1-focus} 
provides an overview the results. The dominant focus is monitoring, analytics and control, representing 27.4\% of the foci described by the participants. Other key foci are services (21.7\% of the participants that described the focus of the systems they built) and quality and security (14.2\%).  
%
Overall, the variety in the types of systems built by the participants and the different foci in activities underpins the representativeness of the data collected during the survey.

\subsubsection{Software engineers working at companies (Q0.3):} Figure~\ref{fig:q0-3} summarises the results of the number of software engineers that work at the companies of the  participants. About half of the companies have more than 100 employees who work as software engineers. The other half is about equally divided over four categories of companies with between 1 and 100 software engineers. The results are similar for all participants and those that have worked with  self-adaptive systems. The numbers show that we collected data from participants of companies with a significant number of software engineers, i.e., people dedicated to building software-intensive systems (because our study is interested in the engineering of software-intensive systems, we collected the number of software engineers at the companies and not the total number of employees as a measure for size).

\subsubsection{Roles of participants in their organisation (Q0.4):} The role(s) that participants have in their company are summarised in Figure~\ref{fig:q0-4}. Of 184 participants, 129 indicated that they have one role in their organisation. The other participants indicated that they have two or more roles. 
Overall, the participants reported on average 1.6 roles in their company. The participants that worked with self-adaptation reported on average 1.5 roles.  The most frequent roles are programmer and project manager/coordinator, each representing over 40\% of the participants. About one in three participants works as a designer or architect. The representation of the other roles is lower in the sample. The relative numbers for the roles of all participants and those that work with self-adaptive systems are again similar. One exception is researcher: 9 of the 10 participants that work as researcher have worked with self-adaptive systems. The results show that we collected data from participants with a broad range of key software engineering roles in industry.

The distributions for all the participants and those that worked with self-adaptation are similar. The numbers show that most participants of the survey are experienced software engineers.

\subsection{Drivers for Applying Self-Adaptation (RQ1)}
\label{subsec:rq1}
We now analyse the data that we collected for answering RQ1. This research question focuses on the drivers of practitioners for applying self-adaptation and the types of problems they solve using self-adaptation. Note that the data used to answer RQ1 comes from the 100 participants that have experience with concrete self-adaptive systems (i.e., the participants that answered ``Yes'' to Q0.1). 

\vspace{5pt}\subsubsection{For which problems do you apply self-adaptation? (Q1.1)}

Figure~\ref{fig:q1-1} summarises the results. On average, the participants applied self-adaptation for 3.6 types of problems from the predefined list (with seven options). The results show that practitioners apply self-adaptation to deal with a variety of problems. Optimising performance and automating tasks are the main problems addressed by self-adaptation in industry. On the other hand, dealing with changes in business goals is less frequently solved using self-adaptation. `Others' include for example support for testing and evolution. 
%Four participants did not indicate any specific types of problems they tackle using self-adaptation.

Figure~\ref{fig:q1-2} summarises the results. On average, the participants provided 2.1 business motivations to apply self-adaptation. Improving user satisfaction, reducing costs, and mitigating risks are the most selected motivations for using self-adaptation. Opening up new application opportunities was selected by a lower number of 21 participants. Examples of `Others' are improving utility and managing complexity.

%\textbf{Overview:} 
Ninety-two participants 
% (94\% of those that worked with self-adaptive systems) 
provided meaningful descriptions of benefits of self-adaptation, an average of 1.8 benefits per participant. 

\textbf{Analysis of comments:} 
We summarise the findings in Table~\ref{tab:codes_q1-3}. For each category (bold font) and code, we include how often it appeared and we provide a few example quotes.\footnote{Categories have codes which express more concrete instances of the categories.}
The dominating benefits of applying self-adaptation are \textit{improved utility} (61 participants), \textit{savings} in costs and resources (38 participants), and \textit{improved human interaction} (37 participants).  

%\end{comment}

\input{tables/codes_q1-3}

\begin{framed}
\noindent \textbf{Key insight(s) from RQ1:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Self-adaptation is widely applied in industry across a wide variety of domains. 
\item Practitioners primarily apply self-adaptation to optimise performance, automate tasks, and deal with changes in the deployment environment. 
\item The dominating business motives to apply self-adaptation in industry are primarily improving user satisfaction and reducing costs, and secondarily 
mitigating risks. 
\item The main benefits of applying self-adaptation are improved utility (in robustness and performance), savings (costs and resources), improved human interaction (user experience and engineers support), and handling dynamics (in the context and system load).  
%\item The problems addressed by industry are in general similar to those studied by academics. Yet, one particular difference is the lack of emphasis of practitioners on the use of self-adaptation to mitigate uncertainties, which has been a key focus in research. 
%\item The four classic management tasks of self-adaptation studied by researchers (self-healing, self-optimising, self-protecting, and self-configuring) are also relevant to practitioners. Yet, different from academics, practitioners also emphasise the importance of improving user satisfaction, reducing costs, and mitigating risks.  
\end{enumerate}
\end{framed}

\subsection{RQ2: Characterisation of Self-adaptation}
\label{subsec:rq2}

\subsubsection{Explain a concrete self-adaptive system you worked with (Q2.1)}

Except for one, all participants with experience in self-adaptation provided a concrete description of a system they worked with. 

\textbf{Analysis of comments:} Tables~\ref{tab:codes_q2-1.I} and~\ref{tab:codes_q2-1.II} summarise the findings. We focused on characteristics of self-adaptive systems and identified three categories: \emph{subject}, \emph{type}, and \emph{trigger} of adaptation. With subject we mean the system or part of it that is adapted; type refers to the kind of adaptation that is applied, and trigger refers to the source that initiates adaptation. 

\input{tables/codes_q2-1}

Ninety-nine participants provided a description of what is the subject of adaptation in the systems they work with. Top results are \emph{system} that occurred 28 times, followed by \emph{module} with 22 times (i.e., a part of a system). \emph{Platform layer} (infrastructure, execution platform, etc.) was mentioned 11 times and \emph{application layer} 11 times. 

Of the participants that worked with self-adaptation, 86 described in total 101 instances of the types of adaptation they apply (i.e., an average of 1.17). \emph{Auto-scaling} with 33 occurrences and \emph{auto-tuning} with 28 are the most frequent types of adaptations applied by the participants. Twenty-two participants focus on \emph{monitoring and analysis} only (they may use the human in the loop for other adaptation functions). 

Finally, 62 participants explained in total 78 triggers of adaptation in their work (i.e., an average of 1.21 triggers). The main triggers originate from \emph{system properties} with 27 occurrences and \emph{environment properties} with 18 occurrences. Changes in the system load, events,\footnote{An event is an occurrence or action that happens asynchronously at some point in time, such as an alarm, an alert, etc.} and user actions are the other types of triggers for adaptation. 



\begin{comment}

Table~\ref{tab:contingency_q0_1_2_2} shows the mapping of system domains (derived from Q0.2) to the (parts of systems that are) subject of adaptation. The results show that self-adaptation is applied to a variety of domains and at different levels of systems. Table~\ref{tab:contingency_q2_2a} shows the mapping of the subject of adaptation to the type of adaptation. The results show that auto-scaling and automated adaptation are broadly applied. On the other hand, auto-tuning and monitor/analysis are primarily applied for adaptation at system level. Table~\ref{tab:contingency_q2_2b} shows the mapping of the type of adaptation to the trigger of adaptation. Remarkably, changes in the (work) load are only applied for auto-scaling.

\begin{framed}
\noindent \textbf{Key insight(s) from RQ2:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Self-adaptation is applied at different levels of industrial software-intensive systems: from a complete system to parts of a system and support systems.  
\item The dominating types of adaptations applied in industry are auto-scaling, auto-tuning, and monitoring/analysis. 
\item Adaptions in industrial software-intensive systems are triggered by changes in properties of systems and their environments, dynamics in system load, relevant events, and through user actions.  
\item Technologies such as elastic cloud and  auto-scalers are key enablers for the realisation of self-adaptation in practice.

\subsection{RQ3: Application of Self-adaptation}
\label{subsec:rq3}

\subsubsection{What mechanisms or tools does the self-adaptive system you worked with use to monitor a managed system during operation? (Q3.1)}

%\textbf{Overview:} 
% Sixty one of 62  participants (98\%) described a mechanism or tool they have used for monitoring in a concrete self-adaptive system they worked with. 
The participants provided a total of 146 instances of mechanisms or tools they used for monitoring in a self-adaptive system they worked with, i.e., on average, 1.5 mechanisms/tools per participant. 

\textbf{Analysis of comments:} Table~\ref{tab:codes_q3-1} summarises the findings. The participants focused on both ``what'' is being monitored and ``how'' monitoring is done. Based on this we identified three categories: \emph{monitoring metrics}, \emph{monitoring mechanisms}, and \emph{monitoring tools}. Of the 100 answers, we marked 14 as unclear. 

\input{tables/codes_q3-1}

The participants mentioned in total 75 metrics they use for monitoring. \emph{Resource usage} with 23 occurrences, \emph{system load} with 18, and \emph{reliability} with 13 are the most frequently mentioned metrics. 

The participants described in total 20 monitoring mechanisms. \emph{Environment sensors} occurred nine times and \emph{system sensors} four times. Six participants described different \emph{logging mechanisms}, and in one system, a \emph{human} is involved in monitoring. 

Finally, the participants provided in total 34 tools they use for monitoring. The most prominent tools are \emph{Kubernetes monitoring} and \emph{Prometheus}, which each occurred nine times, followed by \emph{AWS monitoring} with eight occurrences.\footnote{https://kubernetes.io/ - https://prometheus.io/ - https://aws.amazon.com/}  


\subsubsection{What mechanisms or tools does the self-adaptive system you worked with use analyse conditions of a managed system during operation? (Q3.2)}

The participants provided a total of 115 instances of mechanisms or tools they used for analysing conditions of a self-adaptive system they worked with, i.e., on average 1.5 mechanisms/tools per participant.

\textbf{Analysis of comments:} Table~\ref{tab:codes_q3-2} summarises the findings.
We identified two categories: \emph{analysis mechanisms} and \emph{analysis tools}. Out of the 100 valid answers, 21 were marked as unclear or not applicable (such as ''Fairy simple algoritms'' or ''The tech stack we use is proprietary and the tools we use are built in house''). 
The rest of the participants mentioned in total 73 mechanisms they use for analysis. 
The most frequently mentioned mechanisms are \emph{data analysis methods} (such as interference, statistical data analysis, what-if analysis, and search-based methods) with 18 occurrences, \emph{comparison to threshold} with 16 occurrences, and \emph{metric(s) calculation} and \emph{learning} (mostly machine learning) with 12 occurrences. 
The participants provided in total 23 tools they use for analysis.
\emph{AWS analysis tools} occurred nine times, followed by \emph{Kubernetes stack} with seven, and \emph{Dynatrace} with two occurrences. 
Other tools mentioned by the participants include Splunk, JMX, Jasmina, Azure, Openshift, and Kibana.

\input{tables/codes_q3-2}

\subsubsection{What mechanisms or tools does the self-adaptive system you worked with use to change a managed system or parts of it during operation? (Q3.3)}
The participants provided 126 instances of mechanisms or tools they have used for applying changes, i.e., 1.3 mechanism/tool per participant.

\textbf{Analysis of comments:} Table~\ref{tab:codes_q3-3} summarises the findings.
Out of the 100 valid answers, 23 were marked as unclear or not applicable. We identified two categories: \emph{change mechanisms} and \emph{change enacting tools}. In total, 83 instances of mechanisms for change were reported. \emph{Scaling mechanisms} with 36 occurrences and \emph{reconfiguration} (changing the adaptation logic, network reconfiguration, parameter adjusting, load balancing) with 25 occurrences are the most frequently mentioned changing mechanisms. Twelve participants used \emph{non-automated mechanisms} that refer to notifications and change tasks done by humans. 
%(three participants reported that they even take no action). 
The participants mentioned 19 tools they use for enacting change. \emph{Kubernetes} occurred nine times, \emph{AWS} seven times and other tools, including Openshift and Dynatrace, three times. 

\input{tables/codes_q3-3}

\subsubsection{What is the degree of automation of the majority of the self-adaptive solutions you work with in your organization? (Q3.4)}

All 100 participants provided an answer to this question; Figure~\ref{fig:q3-4} summarises the findings.
Forty-seven participants reported mixed automation in their projects (both semi and fully automated), while 31 indicated semi automation and 19 indicated full automation. Three participants selected other; two of them mentioned that there is no automation, the third stated ``fully-automated till first incident.''

\subsubsection{Do you reuse solutions to realise self-adaptation in systems you work with? (Q3.5)}
All 100 participants provided answers to this question that are summarised in Figure~\ref{fig:q3-5}.
A majority of 71 participants reuse at least sometimes solutions in self-adaptive systems (44 of them reuse solutions frequently to always). The other 29 participants rarely, very rarely or never reuse solutions.

\subsubsection{Please provide a concrete example of reuse you used to realise self-adaptation? (Q3.6)}

Sixty-seven participants provided examples of reuse in the realisation of the self-adaptive systems. 

\textbf{Analysis of comments:} 
Table~\ref{tab:codes_q3-6} summarises the findings. We focused on the subjects of reuse and identified five categories: \emph{code}, \emph{design artifacts}, \emph{specifications}, \emph{IT infrastructure}, and \emph{procedures}. The 67 participants provided in total 91 objects of reuse in adaptation, i.e., an average of 1.4. Code occurred 33 times, with \emph{modules} as the top subject of reuse (18 instances). Design artifacts was mentioned 22 times with \emph{patterns} and \emph{architecture} as main subjects of reuse (each with seven instances). Specification was mentioned 18 times as objects of reuse, IT infrastructure 11 times, and procedures seven times. The results demonstrate that reuse in self-adaptation is common practice, although the use of patterns (a topic that gets increasing attention in research) is limited.  

\input{tables/codes_q3-6}

\subsubsection{Why do you not often reuse solutions
when realising self-adaptive systems?
What hinders their reuse, please provide a
short answer? (Q3.7)}

This was a conditional question that was only asked to the participants that answered never or very rarely to Q3.5 (that asked whether participants reuse solutions to realise self-adaptation). Twenty-three participants provided such an answer to Q3.5.  

\textbf{Analysis of comments:} 
Table~\ref{tab:codes_q3-7} summarises the findings. From 18 participants that provided valid answers, we identified 19 \emph{reuse hurdles}, i.e., an average of 1.1. The main hurdle reported by 11 participants is \emph{difference in problems}, hampering easy reuse. Other hurdles are \emph{lack of experience or maturity} in applying self-adaptation within the company (4 occurrences), and the \emph{complexity of the system} and \emph{organisational concerns} (each with 2 occurrences). 

\input{tables/codes_q3-7}

\subsubsection{How do you ensure that you can trust the self-adaptive solutions you build? (Q3.8)}

Ninety-one of the 100 participants that worked with self-adaptation provided valid answers. 

\textbf{Analysis of comments:} 
Table~\ref{tab:codes_q3-8} summarises the findings. The participants provided in total 152 instances of techniques for ensuring trust in the self-adaptive systems they build, i.e., on average 1.7 techniques per participant. We grouped the techniques in three categories: \emph{testing and verification}, \emph{stakeholder-centred techniques}, \emph{online techniques}. 
Testing and verification was mentioned 71 times with \emph{extensive testing} being the main technique occurring 58 times, followed by \emph{benchmarking} occurring 10 times and verification (three times). Stakeholder-centred techniques were mentioned 45 times. In this category, \emph{human supervision} (22 occurrences) and \emph{rigorous design and development} (10 occurrences) were the main reported techniques. Finally, online techniques were mentioned 36 times with \emph{runtime monitoring and alerting} as main reported technique (27 occurrences). In contrast to an important focus of research in self-adaptation, (formal) \emph{verification} as a technique to ensure trust was only mentioned three times.   

\input{tables/codes_q3-8}

\begin{framed}
\noindent \textbf{Key insight(s) from RQ3:} 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Resource usage and system load are the main types of monitoring metrics used in practice. These metrics are primarily tracked by sensors in the environment and the system.  
\item Practitioners use various mechanisms for analysis in realising self-adaptation, with data analysis methods and comparison to thresholds as main mechanisms.   
\item A wide range of mechanisms are used to enact self-adaptation in industrial systems with auto-scaling and reconfiguration as top mechanisms. 
\item Practitioners extensively rely on tools such as Kubernetes and AWS to support the realisation of different functions of self-adaptation. 
\item Industrial systems apply a mix of semi and fully automated adaptation. 
\item A majority of practitioners reuse solutions when applying self-adaptation, mainly in the form of code, design artifacts, and specifications. 
\item Ensuring trust in industrial self-adaptive systems is mainly achieved through extensive testing, runtime monitoring and alerting, and human supervision. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{RQ4: Difficulties, Problem Support, and Opportunities}
\label{subsec:rq4}

\subsubsection{Did you encounter particular difficulties when engineering or maintaining self-adaptive systems you worked with? (Q4.1)} Figure~\ref{fig:q4-1} summarises the findings. Forty-one of 100 participants report that they sometimes face difficulties with applying self-adaptation. Thirty encounter difficulties frequently or very frequently, while 17 rarely or very rarely have difficulties. Four participants reported to have always problems, while eight reported that they never face difficulties.

%\textbf{Analysis of comments:} 


\subsubsection{Please give one or two examples of the difficulties that you encountered when engineering or maintaining self-adaptive systems. (Q4.2)}

Seventy-four participants reported in total 140  difficulties, i.e., on average 1.9 difficulties per participant. Table~\ref{tab:codes_q4-2} summarises the findings.

\input{tables/codes_q4-2}

\textbf{Analysis of comments:} We identified four categories of difficulties: \emph{design issues}, \emph{lifecycle issues}, \emph{runtime issues}, and \emph{people and process issues}. Most frequently reported difficulties, 43 in total, relate to the design of self-adaptation, in particular \emph{reliable/optimal design} (26 occurrences) and \emph{design complexity} (17 occurrences). Life cycle issues were reported 42 times, in particular \emph{tuning/debugging} (19 occurrences) and \emph{limitations of tools and methods} (13 occurrences). Difficulties with runtime aspects of self-adaptive systems was reported 30 times with \emph{runtime uncertainty} mentioned 17 times, and difficulties related to people and process occurred 25 times with \emph{skills and experience} occurring 14 times.  

\subsubsection{Did you face any risks when engineering self-adaptive systems? (Q4.3)}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:q4-3} summarises the findings. 
Thirty-four of 100 participants report that they sometimes face risks when engineering self-adaptive systems. Eighteen report that they frequently to always encounter risks, while 48 rarely to never face risks. 
%It is remarkable that more than 50\% of the participants report that they face at least sometimes risks with applying self-adaptation.

\subsubsection{Briefly describe one or two risks that you faced when engineering self-adaptive systems. (Q4.4)}

The participants provided a total of 60 responses containing 66 instances of risks faced when engineering self-adaptive systems.
On average, the participants reported 1.3 risks.

\textbf{Analysis of comments:} 
%
Tables~\ref{tab:codes_q4-4.I} and~\ref{tab:codes_q4-4.II} summarise the findings.
Out of the 60 valid answers, 11 were marked as unclear or not applicable.
We identified four categories of risks: \emph{faults}, \emph{difficulties with development/operation}, \emph{impact on qualities}, and \emph{impact on business}. 
Most frequently mentioned risks, 20 in total, relate to faults, in particular \emph{incorrect functionality} (7 occurrences), \emph{wrong results} and \emph{misconfiguration} (4 occurrences each), and \emph{network failure} (2 occurrences).
Difficulties with development/operation relate to \emph{difficulties to manage environment uncertainty} (6 occurrences), and \emph{difficulties to test} and \emph{build systems} (4 occurrences each). 
Participants mentioned also the risk of having several qualities impacted; \emph{performance degradation} with 5 occurrences the most frequent, followed by \emph{reduced availability} and \emph{safety and security threats} with 4 occurrences each.
Finally, negative impact on the business in terms of \emph{increased cost} (5 occurrences) and \emph{losing control and trust} (4 occurrences) are also reported as important risks when applying self-adaptation. 

\input{tables/codes_q4-4}

\subsubsection{How did you mitigate the risks that you faced? (Q4.5)}

The participants provided 51 responses containing 66 instances of risk mitigating techniques when engineering self-adaptive systems, i.e., 
on average 1.3 techniques per participant.

\textbf{Analysis of comments:} 
Table~\ref{tab:codes_q4-5} summarises the findings.
Out of the 100 valid answers, 13 were marked as unclear or not applicable.
The other participants mentioned a variety of risk mitigation mechanisms, which we grouped into three categories. 
\emph{Stakeholder-centred techniques} are the largest category with 25 occurrences, followed by \emph{offline techniques} and \emph{online techniques} with 18 and 9 occurrences each. 
Within stakeholder-centred techniques, \emph{rigorous design and development} (8 occurrences), \emph{code review} (4 occurrences), and \emph{human supervision} (4 occurrences) are the most popular risk mitigation techniques. 
\emph{Extensive testing} with 15 occurrences is the mostly mentioned offline technique, while \emph{runtime monitoring and analysis} with 6 occurrences is the mostly mentioned online technique to mitigate risks.

\subsubsection{Have you faced or seen any problems
of self-adaptation for which you would
appreciate support from researchers (Q4.6)}
%
Figure~\ref{fig:q4-6} summarises the findings for Q4.6. Thirty-three of 166 participants (17.9\%) frequently to always experience problems with self-adaptation for which they would appreciate support from researchers, while 43 participants (23.4\%) sometimes face such problems. On the other hand, 108 of the participants (58.7\%) never to rarely experience problems for which they would appreciate support from researchers. In summary, almost half of the participants believe that they would benefit from support of researchers to address some of the problems they face with engineering self-adaptive systems.

%Thirty two of 166 participants (42.2\%) sometimes to always experience problems with self-adaptation for which they would appreciate support from researchers. On the other hand, 96 participants (57.8\%) rarely or never experience such problems. 

%Sixty nine of 166 participants (57.8\%) rarely to never experience problems with self-adaptation for which they would appreciate support from researchers. On the other hand, 32 participants (42.2\%) sometimes to always experience problems with self-adaptation for which they would appreciate support from researchers.

%Forty five of 166 participants (27\%) never experience problems with self-adaptation for which they would appreciate support from researchers. The remaining 121 participants (73\%) experience problems (from very rarely to always) with applying self-adaptation for which they would appreciate support from researchers.


\subsubsection{For which problems of self-adaptation
would you appreciate support from researchers? Please briefly explain one or two such problems (Q4.7)}

Sixty-five participants described in total 113 problems for which they would appreciate support from researchers. Tables~\ref{tab:codes_q4-7.I} and~\ref{tab:codes_q4-7.II} summarise the findings.

\textbf{Analysis of comments:} 
We grouped the problems in four categories: \emph{engineering}, \emph{guarantees}, \emph{data}, and \emph{user interaction}. Forty-eight of the reported problems (42.5\% of the reported problems for which practitioners would appreciate support from researchers) relate to the engineering of self-adaptive systems. The main problems in this category relate to \emph{architecture and reuse} (16 occurrences) and the \emph{adoption} of self-adaptation (10 occurrences). Adoption refers to problems within a company with introducing self-adaptation, which can be related to technical aspects, expertise, or organisational aspect. Twenty-five of the reported problems (22.1\% of all reported problems) relate to guarantees, in particular providing \emph{trustworthiness} (20 occurrences) and dealing with \emph{unknowns} (five occurrences). Problems related to data were reported by 21 practitioners (18.6\%) and include \emph{data governance} and \emph{data access} (both eight occurrences), and \emph{machine learning} (five occurrences). The remaining 19 problems (16.8\%) relate to user interaction, namely \emph{automation} (nine times) and \emph{user experience} (seven times).   

\input{tables/codes_q4-7}

\subsubsection{In your organisation or in industry in general, do you see application opportunities for self-adaptation that are currently not exploited? (Q4.8)}

Of the 184 participants, 101 (54.4\%) highlight new opportunities for applying self-adaptation, while 83 do not report any. The number of participants within these two groups is almost equally split among participants who have worked with concrete self-adaptive systems and those who have not (see Q0.1) (in particular, 58 participants that worked with self-adaptive systems report opportunities, while 42 do not).

\subsubsection{Please describe or give examples of the application opportunities for self-adaptation that are currently not exploited (Q4.9)}

Eighty-five participants described in total 147 unexploited opportunities for applying self-adaptation, i.e., an average of 1.7 opportunities per participant. 

\input{tables/codes_q4-9}

\textbf{Analysis of comments:} 
Tables~\ref{tab:codes_q4-9.I} and~\ref{tab:codes_q4-9.II} summarise the findings.
We grouped the opportunities in four categories: \emph{system activity}, \emph{system property}, \emph{engineering activity}, and \emph{human involvement}. Seventy-two of the reported opportunities (i.e., 49\% of all) are related to system activity. The opportunities in this category relate to the \emph{autonomous operation} behaviour of self-adaptive systems (37 occurrences), \emph{data management and machine learning} (26 occurrences), and \emph{auto-scaling} (nine occurrences). Forty-seven opportunities (32\%) are related to system properties. In this category, the opportunities are related to \emph{quality improvement} (26 occurrences), 
\emph{security improvement} (10 occurrences), and \emph{cost effectiveness} (eight occurrences). Twenty-one of the reported opportunities (14.3\%) relate to engineering activities, in particular \emph{maintenance and reuse} (15 occurrences), and \emph{patterns and libraries} (six occurrences). Finally, seven opportunities (4.8\%) relate to human involvement, in particular \emph{personalisation} (four occurrences) and \emph{human-machine interaction} (three occurrences).  
%\newpage

%We also performed an alternative coding of opportunities according to the sector they belong to. 
%Participants described in total 66 opportunities based on the sector analysis.
%Table~\ref{tab:q4-9a} summarises the findings.
%Thirty six of 66 opportunities (55\%) are not specific to any sector. The largest sector category is Cloud \& Microservices with 11 occurrences (17\%), while important sectors are also Telco and CPS with 7 and 6 occurrences, respectively. 
%The remaining two categories are Transportation and Other, each with 3 occurrences. 
%The later includes single mentions of energy, mobile systems and healthcare. 

%We finally performed a cross analysis that revealed that (i) Cross-sector opportunities are almost evenly split among the labels of Table~\ref{tab:codes_q4-9}, (ii) the vast majority of Cloud \& Microservices opportunities are related to autoscaling.
