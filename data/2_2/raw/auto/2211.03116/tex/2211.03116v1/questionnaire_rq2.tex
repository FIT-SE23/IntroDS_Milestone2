Q3.1 & What mechanisms or tools does the self-adaptive system you worked with use to monitor a managed system during operation? By monitor, we mean tracking properties of the system or its environment. & Free text\\
Q3.2 & What mechanisms or tools does the self-adaptive system you worked with use to analyse conditions of a managed system during operation? By analyse, we mean examining conditions of the system or its environment and determining whether any adaptation is required or not. & Free text\\
Q3.3 & What mechanisms or tools does the self-adaptive system you worked with use to change a managed system or parts of it during operation? By change, we mean adjusting parameters of the system, or adding, removing or changing any parts of it. & Free text\\
Q3.4 & What is the degree of automation of the majority of the self-adaptive solutions you work with in your organisation? & Semi-automated; Fully automated; Mixed (Semi and Fully Automated); Other (free text)\\
Q3.5 & Do you reuse solutions to realise self-adaptation in systems you work with? & Never; Very Rarely; Rarely; Sometimes; Frequently; Very Frequently; Always \\
Q3.6 & Please provide a concrete example of reuse you used to realise self-adaptation? & Free text \\
Q3.7 & Why do you not often reuse solutions when realising self-adaptive systems? What hinders the reuse, please provide a short answer. & Free text\\
Q3.8 & How do you ensure that you can trust the self-adaptive solutions you build? Examples could be extensive testing or human supervision, but you may use other means. Please describe briefly. & Free text\\
