\section{Conclusions}
Federated Learning, as one of the enabling technologies laying the foundation for Metaverse, provides powerful collaborative data analysis tools with privacy protection guarantees. Facing severe constraints and key challenges of incorporating FL into Industrial Metaverse, that is, data heterogeneity, learning forgetting, and limited bandwidth, this paper proposed a high-performance and efficient FL system, named \NAME, to simultaneously address these three challenges. This system uses a new concept of STP training mode to achieve dynamic collaboration between devices, and a fast ICG algorithm to group devices and minimize heterogeneity. Then, SCC is proposed to address learning forgetting induced by streaming data, which compensates for the forgotten knowledge by fusing compressed historical data semantics and calibrates only classifier parameters. Finally, the system runs in LASP protocol to block the transmission of redundant parameters and reduce communication costs. Extensive experiments were conducted on the static and streamed non-i.i.d. FEMNIST dataset. Numerical results clearly show that \NAME~achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to eight benchmarks in both settings, with significantly a higher accuracy, faster convergence, less runtime, and lower communication costs. These advantages demonstrate the advanced performance of our \NAME~system on streaming non-i.i.d. data.
