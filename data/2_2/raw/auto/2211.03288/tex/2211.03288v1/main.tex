\begin{abstract}

Union-Find (UF) and Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) are popular decoder designs for surface codes.
The former has significantly lower time complexity than the latter but is considered somewhat inferior, in terms of decoding accuracy.
In this work we present an interpretation of UF decoders that explains why UF and MWPM decoders perform closely in some cases: the UF decoder is an approximate implementation of the blossom algorithm used for MWPM.
This interpretation allows a generalization of UF decoders for weighted decoding graphs and explains why UF decoders achieve high accuracy for certain surface codes.
