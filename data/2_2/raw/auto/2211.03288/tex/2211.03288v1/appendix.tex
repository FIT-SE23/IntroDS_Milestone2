\subsection{Structured Proof}\label{ap:structured-proof}
We opt for the style of proof known as structured ~\cite{lamport2012write} for its clarity.
A structured proof employs a hierarchical structure that provides both the high-level idea and low-level details.
The proof consists of steps organized in multiple layers.
Each step is prefixed with $\langle n \rangle m$, which means it is the $m$-th step of the $n$-th layer.
Every step comes with a proof, either a single sentence prefixed with \proofPfkwd\ or a sub layer ending with \qedstepPfkwd.
