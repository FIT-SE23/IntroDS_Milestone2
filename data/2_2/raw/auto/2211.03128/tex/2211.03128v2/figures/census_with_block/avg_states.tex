    \caption{[INCLUDES block attribute] We average results across a randomly selected tracts from each state, comparing top $k$ candidate \matchrate~ of \rapattack~ against track, county and state baselines. The $x$-axis corresponds to different value of $k$ and the underlying dataset is a track of the Census tables. The figure shows that the \rapattack~ attack guesses more rows of the private data than knowing the county or state distribution but worse than knowing the distribution at the track level.}
