\begin{abstract}

This paper presents a learning framework to estimate an agent capability and task requirement model for multi-agent task allocation.
With a set of team configurations and the corresponding task performances as the training data, linear task constraints can be learned to be embedded in many existing optimization-based task allocation frameworks.
Comprehensive computational evaluations are conducted to test the scalability and prediction accuracy of the learning framework with a limited number of team configurations and performance pairs.
A ROS and Gazebo-based simulation environment is developed to validate the proposed requirements learning and task allocation framework in practical multi-agent exploration and manipulation tasks.
Results show that the learning process for scenarios with 40 tasks and 6 types of agents uses around 12 seconds, ending up with prediction errors in the range of 0.5-2\%.
