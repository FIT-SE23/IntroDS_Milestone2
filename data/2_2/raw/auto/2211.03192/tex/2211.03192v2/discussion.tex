In this paper we have presented an approach for integration free learning of flow maps, where we use coordinate-based neural networks as surrogates for fast and accurate flow map computation. We achieve this through our novel network design and optimization scheme that takes advantage of the basic properties of flow maps, in order to learn only using the provided vector field. We demonstrate the strength of our technique experimentally by comparing our method with various baselines and across multiple datasets.

There are several research directions we intend to pursue for future work. First, we acknowledge that although our method is scalable to optimize relative to other methods, optimization remains the computational bottleneck. We expect that porting our optimization scheme to the GPU, using fully-fused CUDA kernels for both the grid and MLPs, will alleviate this cost, as studied in prior works~\cite{weiss2021fast,muller2022instant}. Additionally, our self-consistency scheme is only an approximation, whereas other approaches have studied the design of invertible neural networks for computing discrete~\cite{behrmann2019invertible} or continuous~\cite{chen2018neuralode,bilovs2021neural} mappings of learned representations. We believe that adopting such approaches for representing flow maps in 2D and 3D unsteady flows is a fruitful research avenue.
