In this section, we describe three add-on components for the core XYZ system. Note that the efficacy and effectiveness of the add-on components are not included in this paper because the main focus of the paper is the XYZ system. The add-on components exist to assist the XYZ system by storing the audio clips classified by the XYZ system (in the cloud), sending the identified anger to the caregiver for them for them to be more attentive to their own emotions, and notifying the developers when the XYZ system crashes. In addition to those assistive functionalities, one of the add-ons, the Recommender System, recommends tips to the caregivers to help them manage their anger. The entirety of the XYZ system and its add-ons is referred to as the \emph{XYZ-W} (XYZ-Whole) System. An overview of the XYZ-W system is described in Figure \ref{fig:XYZ_w_overview}.

One of the add-on components is the Recommender System with the EMA. Recommender system uses reinforcement learning to decide if a conflict/anger management tip should be sent and what tip to send. The EMA is a smartphone app developed to send messages to the caregivers. Another add-on component, the Cloud keeps track of the raw acoustic signal files, the SID module's detection on the identity of the speaker, the emotion classification module's classification result, the conflict detection module's detection result, and the recommendations and user responses. 

The final add-on component is the M2G System \cite{ma2017m} that monitors the other three components to make sure that they are alive. If one or more of the other three components crash, the M2G system restarts the component(s) and sends the developers an email to announce the crash so the developers can investigate the causes.
