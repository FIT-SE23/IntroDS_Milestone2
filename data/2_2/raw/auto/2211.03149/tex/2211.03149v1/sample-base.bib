%% The “SSPNet Conflict Corpus” is a collection of 45 political debates in the French language that were televised in Switzerland. It represents approximately 12 h of speech signals; 1,430 audio clips of 30 s duration were extracted from the corpus. A total of 157 individuals were speaking in the collection of debates (23 females and 134 males). In the various multiparty discussions of the debates, the roles of the group members were distinguished: a member of the group held the role of moderator, and the other members were participants who were taking part in the debate. Four moderators (1 female, 3 males) and 153 participants (22 females, 131 males) were counted in the database. The SSPNET corpus was distributed for the Interspeech 2013 ComParE Challenge. Data were split into the Train, Development, and Test sets: 793 clips were in the Train set, 240 clips were in the Development set, and 397 were in the Test set. 

%% turn-taking patterns and overlaps between speakers are shown to be informative with respect to classification into the presence or absence of conflict.


%% Automatic conflict detection has grown in relevance with the advent of body-worn technology, but existing metrics such as turn-taking and overlap are poor indicators of conflict in police-public interactions. Moreover, standard techniques to compute them fall short when applied to such diversified and noisy contexts. We develop a pipeline catered to this task combining adaptive noise removal, non-speech filtering and new measures of conflict based on the repetition and intensity of phrases in speech. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on body-worn audio data collected by the Los Angeles Police Department.

%% conflict detection in noisy environments


%% The experiments are performed on a dataset of dyadic interactions between professional aggression training actors (actors) and naive participants (students) interacting freely based on short role descriptions. Our findings show that overlapping speech is a key feature for predicting aggression levels, that discriminating only severe cases of overlap is a sufficient feature and that automatically predicted overlap is improving aggression recognition as well.

%% OVERLAP SPEECH IS INDICATIVE OF CONFLICT, NOT AN ALGORITHM

% Our results with this approach were only partially successful. The UAR of our predictions was just as high as to those given by our models built on the whole audio file, up to 80 when trained and cross-validated on the development and training set together. Since this accuracy is as high as our best model, it suggests that escalation and de-escalation are indeed useful features to detect conflict. While we have not shown that it performs better than global features, it remains an interesting concept for future work

It represents approximately 12 h of speech signals; 1,430 audio clips of 30 s duration were extracted from the corpus. A total of 157 individuals were speaking in the collection of debates (23 females and 134 males). In the various multiparty discussions of the debates, the roles of the group members were distinguished: a member of the group held the role of moderator, and the other members were participants who were taking part in the debate. Four moderators (1 female, 3 males) and 153 participants (22 females, 131 males) were counted in the database. The SSPNET corpus was distributed for the Interspeech 2013 ComParE Challenge. Data were split into the Train, Development, and Test sets: 793 clips were in the Train set, 240 clips were in the Development set, and 397 were in the Test set. 

%% turn-taking patterns and overlaps between speakers are shown to be informative with respect to classification into the presence or absence of conflict.

%% Automatic conflict detection has grown in relevance with the advent of body-worn technology, but existing metrics such as turn-taking and overlap are poor indicators of conflict in police-public interactions. Moreover, standard techniques to compute them fall short when applied to such diversified and noisy contexts. We develop a pipeline catered to this task combining adaptive noise removal, non-speech filtering and new measures of conflict based on the repetition and intensity of phrases in speech. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on body-worn audio data collected by the Los Angeles Police Department.

%% The experiments are performed on a dataset of dyadic interactions between professional aggression training actors (actors) and naive participants (students) interacting freely based on short role descriptions. Our findings show that overlapping speech is a key feature for predicting aggression levels, that discriminating only severe cases of overlap is a sufficient feature and that automatically predicted overlap is improving aggression recognition as well.

%% OVERLAP SPEECH IS INDICATIVE OF CONFLICT, NOT AN ALGORITHM



% Our results with this approach were only partially successful. The UAR of our predictions was just as high as to those given by our models built on the whole audio file, up to 80 when trained and cross-validated on the development and training set together. Since this accuracy is as high as our best model, it suggests that escalation and de-escalation are indeed useful features to detect conflict. While we have not shown that it performs better than global features, it remains an interesting concept for future work

TUT Sound Events 2016 consists of residential area and home environments, and is manually annotated to mark onset, offset and label of sound events. In this paper we present the recording and annotation procedure, the database content, a recommended cross-validation setup and performance of supervised acoustic scene classification system and event detection baseline system using mel frequency cepstral coefficients and Gaussian mixture models. The database is publicly released to provide support for algorithm development and common ground for comparison of different techniques.",
