\section{Conclusion}
As research projects (not pilot studies), smart health groups often design novel smart technologies to be deployed in people's homes. However, the integration of novel smart technology from the less complex lab environments to the more complex real environments poses many challenges. In this paper, using the XYZ system as a case study, we present and evaluate various techniques for acoustic pipelines, adaptability of the user interface, and privacy that increase deployment time success.
