\section{Conclusion}

We have characterized the efficiency of two mainstream GNN frameworks with three state-of-the-art sampling-based GNNs and six real-world graph datasets, which cover a wide range of graph sizes. We have conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of each key component of GNN models and frameworks as well as each GNN's model performance from the efficiency perspective in runtime and power/energy consumption. We expect that our observations at many different levels would be useful for further improvement and optimization of GNN models and frameworks.
