\section{An Example for the Usefulness of Cycles}

The following example shows why particles may prefer to travel along walks containing cycles in networks with capacity constraints. This means that the equilibria in such a network can be different depending on whether the strategy space of the particles only includes paths or also walks containing cycles.

	\caption{A single-commodity network with fixed network inflow rate where allowing particles to travel along cycles changes (improves) the equilibrium flow. All edges have a flow independent travel time as given in the figure. The capacities of all edges except for edge $e_1$ are infinite.}\label{fig:ImprovementByCycles}
\end{figure}

\begin{example}\label{ex:ImprovementByCycles}
	The network in \Cref{fig:ImprovementByCycles} is an example for a single commodity network with volume-constraints on the edges where it makes a difference for the resulting equilibrium whether travelling along cycles is allowed or not. If cycles are not allowed, only half of the flow can use the short edge $e_1$ towards the sink while the rest of the flow has to take the much longer edge $e_2$. If, on the other hand, cycles are allowed, particles can use the cycle $s\to v \to s$ to essentially wait at the source node until there is again room on edge $e_1$. In other word, in this example individual particles prefer to travel along a cycle.
