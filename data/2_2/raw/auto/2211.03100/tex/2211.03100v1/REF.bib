abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a system of integrating activity recognition and collecting nursing care records at nursing care facilities as well as activity labels and sensors through smartphones, and describe experiments at a nursing care facility for 4 months. A system designed to be used even by staff not familiar with smartphones could collected enough number of data without losing but improving their workload for recording. For collected data, we revealed the nature of the collected data as for activities, care details, and timestamps, and considering them, we show a reference accuracy of recognition of nursing activity which is durable to time skewness, overlaps, and class imbalances. Moreover, we demonstrate the near future prediction to predict the next day's activities from the previous day's records which could be useful for proactive care management. The dataset collected is to be opened to the research community, and can be the utilized for activity recognition and data mining in care facilities.},

abstract = {We consider a novel problem called Activity Prediction, where the goal is to predict the future activity occurrence times from sensor data. In this paper, we make three main contributions. First, we formulate and solve the activity prediction problem in the framework of imitation learning and reduce it to simple regression learning problem. This approach allows us to leverage powerful regression learners; is easy to implement; and can reason about the relational and temporal structure of the problem with negligible computational overhead. Second, we present several evaluation metrics to evaluate a given activity predictor, and discuss their pros and cons in the context of real-world applications. Third, we evaluate our approach using real sensor data collected from 24 smart home testbeds. We also embed the learned predictor into a mobile device based activity prompter and evaluate the app on multiple participants living in smart homes. Our experimental results indicate that the activity predictor learned with our approach performs better than the baseline methods, and offers a simple and reliable approach to prediction of activities from sensor data.},

abstract = {As the number of patients in hospitals is increasing day by day, proper monitoring and hospital care towards patients must be ensured. In this regard, Nurse care activity recognition can play a significant role in improving the existing healthcare system. Research in this domain is very challenging because nursing activities are very complex and troublesome than other normal activities. Nursing activities are dependent not only on nurses but also on the patients’ various states of illness. As a result, each activity has a high intra-class variation. We have participated in ’3rd Nurse Care Activity Recognition Challenge 2021’ and proposed a simple machine learning approach to recognize nursing activities. After data pre-processing and feature engineering, we have used several machine learning algorithms. Among them, we have achieved our best results in the Random Forest model. Using this model, We have obtained 72 percent validation accuracy classifying several challenging activities.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition is a challenging task due to complexity and variations of human movements while performing activities by different subjects. Extracting features to model the temporal evolution of different movements plays an important role in this task. In this paper, we present the approach followed by our team, Dark_Shadow, to recognize complex nurse activities in the "Nurse Care Activity Recognition Challenge" [1]. We present a deep learning method to capture the movements of essential body parts from time series of human activity data collected by sensors and then classify them. Deep learning approaches have provided satisfactory results in various human activity recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model with attention mechanism to recognize the nurse activities. We obtain approximately 66.43% accuracy for person-wise one leave out cross validation.},

abstract = {Human activity recognition on sensor data plays a vital role in health monitoring and elderly care service monitoring. Although tremendous progress has been noticed to the use of sensor technology to collect activity recognition data, recognition still remains challenging due to the pervasive nature of the activities. In this paper, we present a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model by our team DataDrivers_BD in "The 2nd Nurse Care Activity Recognition Challenge Using Lab and Field Data" which is quite challenging because of the similarity among the tasks. On the other hand, the dissimilarity among the users patterns of working for a particular task. Since CNN can retrieve informative features automatically, it has become one of the most prominent methods in activity recognition. Our extensive experiment on nurse care activity recognition challenge dataset also achieved significant accuracy of 91.59% outperforming the existing state of the art algorithms.},
