\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
%In this paper, we have introduced a novel optimization model for dense subgraph discovery in multilayer networks.
%Our model aims to find a stochastic solution, i.e., a probability distribution over the family of vertex subsets,
%rather than a single vertex subset, whereas it can also be used for obtaining a single vertex subset. 
%For the model, we designed an LP-based polynomial-time exact algorithm together with a simple, scalable preprocessing algorithm.
%Computational experiments demonstrate the validity of our model and the effectiveness of our algorithms.

In this paper, we have introduced a novel optimization model and algorithms for dense subgraph discovery in multilayer networks. 
There are several possible directions for future research.
One direction is to improve the scalability of our algorithm, particularly for the regret metric, 
for which our preprocessing algorithm does not necessarily perform well. 
Another direction is to apply our model and algorithms to some real-world applications of multilayer-network analysis. 
Investigating multilayer-network counterparts of some existing generalizations of the densest subgraph problem (see e.g., \cite{Kawase_Miyauchi_17,Miyauchi_Kakimura_18,Tsourakakis_15,Veldt+21}) is also interesting future work.
