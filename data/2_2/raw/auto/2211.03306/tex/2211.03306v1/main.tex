\begin{abstract}  % put your abstract here!
  Network analysis has played a key role in knowledge discovery and data mining.
  In many real-world applications in recent years, we are interested in mining \emph{multilayer networks},
  where we have a number of edge sets called \emph{layers},
  which encode different types of connections and/or time-dependent connections over the same set of vertices.
  Among many network analysis techniques, dense subgraph discovery, aiming to find a dense component in a network, is an essential primitive with a variety of applications in diverse domains.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel optimization model for dense subgraph discovery in multilayer networks.
  Our model aims to find a stochastic solution, i.e., a probability distribution over the family of vertex subsets,
  rather than a single vertex subset, whereas it can also be used for obtaining a single vertex subset.
  For our model, we design an LP-based polynomial-time exact algorithm.
  Moreover, to handle large-scale networks, we also devise a simple, scalable preprocessing algorithm, which often reduces the size of the input networks significantly and results in a substantial speed-up.
  Computational experiments demonstrate the validity of our model and the effectiveness of our algorithms.
  %Computational experiments using synthetic graphs and real-world networks demonstrate the validity of our model and the effectiveness of our algorithms.
  %In this paper, we investigate dense subgraph discovery in multilayer networks from a game-theoretic viewpoint.\memo{why?} Specifically, we introduce a Stackelberg game model\memo{who is the leader or the follower? How does it connect to dense subgraph mining in your setting?}, enabling us to consider the uncertainty to layers.\memo{not clear} For our model, we design an LP-based polynomial-time exact algorithm.\memo{to solve what problem?} Moreover, to handle large-scale networks, we also devise a simple, scalable preprocessing algorithm\memo{why do you need to do it? I am guessing your LP is not efficient?}, which often reduces the size of the input networks significantly. Computational experiments using synthetic graphs and real-world networks\memo{would be good to say what they are} demonstrate the validity of our model and the effectiveness of our algorithms. \memo{with respect to what measure?}
