%Automatic summarization of legal documents is an important and practical challenge. 
Though many %domain-independent and domain-specific summarization 
algorithms can be used to automatically summarize legal case decisions,  most 
fail to incorporate domain knowledge about how important sentences in a legal decision relate to a representation of its document structure. For example, analysis of a  legal case summarization dataset demonstrates that sentences serving different  types of argumentative roles in the decision appear in different sections %or paragraphs 
of the document. 
In this work, we propose an unsupervised graph-based ranking model that uses a reweighting algorithm to exploit properties of the document structure of legal case decisions.  We also explore the impact of using different methods to compute the  document structure. Results on the Canadian Legal Case Law %(CANLII)
dataset  show that our proposed method outperforms several strong %summarization 
baselines. % in terms of ROUGE scores and BERTScore.

%Automatic summarization of legal documents is an important
%and practical challenge. Though many domain-independent and domain-specific summarization algorithms can be used for this purpose,  most of these algorithms fail to incorporate the domain knowledge of what should be the important information presented in a legal case document. Our analysis on a legal case summarziation dataset demonstrates that legal document writers tend to organize the \textit{argumentative} information into different sections or paragraphs.  In this work, we propose an unsupervised graph-based ranking model that exploits the document structure of the legal texts. Results on the Canadian Legal Case Law (CANLII) dataset  and American Bill dataset (BillSum) show that our proposed method outperforms several strong baselines in terms of ROUGE scores and BERTScore.
