\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This work contribution is twofold: a formal description of stylistic backdoors and JingleBack, the first stylistic backdoor in the audio domain. 
We demonstrated the potential of our attack through an extensive evaluation considering 444 models, reaching up to 96\% of the attack success rate.  
Future investigations are required to better understand the stylistic backdoors in the audio domain, for example, by considering the impact of the target class or, more in general, how to find an optimal style effective in both clean and dirty label settings. 
Finally, further investigation is needed regarding the stylistic backdoor's behavior against state-of-the-art countermeasures.
