@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="It is worth noting that the $\Delta $CSF, $\Delta $CISD, and $\Delta $CISD+Q excitation energies are invariant under rotations within the doubly-occupied and virtual blocks, although the $\Delta $CISD+EN2 energies are not, which is well-known for the EN2 perturbative correction. \cite {Garniron_2019}"}
