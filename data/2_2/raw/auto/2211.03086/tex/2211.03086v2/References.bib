Background},
journal = {\apj},
abstract = {One of the main challenges facing upcoming cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments will be to distinguish the cosmological signal from foreground contamination. We present a comprehensive treatment of this problem and study how foregrounds degrade the accuracy with which the Boomerang, MAP, and Planck experiments can measure cosmological parameters. Our foreground model includes not only the normalization, frequency dependence, and scale dependence for each physical component, but also variations in frequency dependence across the sky. When estimating how accurately cosmological parameters can be measured, we include the important complication that foreground model parameters (we use about 500) must be simultaneously measured from the data as well. Our results are quite encouraging: despite all these complications, precision measurements of most cosmological parameters are degraded by less than a factor of 2 for our main foreground model and by less than a factor of 5 in our most pessimistic scenario. Parameters measured though large-angle polarization signals suffer more degradation: up to 5 in the main model and 25 in the pessimistic case. The foregrounds that are potentially most damaging and therefore most in need of further study are vibrating dust emission and point sources, especially those in the radio frequencies. It is well known that E and B polarization contain valuable information about reionization and gravity waves, respectively. However, the cross-correlation between polarized and unpolarized foregrounds also deserves further study, as we find that it carries the bulk of the polarization information about most other cosmological parameters.}

We demonstrate that these distortions are sufficient to conceal the 21 cm signal when the antenna is not perfectly achromatic and that simple corrections assuming a constant spatial distribution of foreground power are insufficient to overcome them. We then propose a new physics-motivated method of modelling the foregrounds of 21 cm experiments in order to fit the chromatic distortions as part of the foregrounds. This is done by generating a simulated sky model across the observing band by dividing the sky into N regions and scaling a base map assuming a distinct uniform spectral index in each region. The resulting sky map can then be convolved with a model of the antenna beam to give a model of foregrounds and chromaticity parametrized by the spectral indices of the N regions. We demonstrate that fitting this model for varying N using a Bayesian nested sampling algorithm and comparing the results using the evidence allows the 21 cm signal to be reliably detected in data of a relatively smooth conical log spiral antenna. We also test a much more chromatic conical sinuous antenna and find this model will not produce a reliable signal detection, but in a manner that is easily distinguishable from a true detection.}",

abstract = {Radar instruments are part of the core payload of the two Europa Jupiter System Mission (EJSM) spacecraft: NASA-led Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO) and ESA-led Jupiter Ganymede Orbiter (JGO). At this point of the project, several frequency bands are under study for radar, which ranges between 5 and 50MHz. Part of this frequency range overlaps with that of the natural jovian radio emissions, which are very intense in the decametric range, below 40MHz. Radio observations above 40MHz are free of interferences, whereas below this threshold, careful observation strategies have to be investigated. We present a review of spectral intensity, variability and sources of these radio emissions. As the radio emissions are strongly beamed, it is possible to model the visibility of the radio emissions, as seen from the vicinity of Europa or Ganymede. We have investigated Io-related radio emissions as well as radio emissions related to the auroral oval. We also review the radiation belts synchrotron emission characteristics. We present radio sources visibility products (dynamic spectra and radio source location maps, on still frames or movies), which can be used for operation planning. This study clearly shows that a deep understanding of the natural radio emissions at Jupiter is necessary to prepare the future EJSM radar instrumentation. We show that this radio noise has to be taken into account very early in the observation planning and strategies for both JGO and JEO. We also point out possible synergies with RPW (Radio and Plasma Waves) instrumentations.}

title = {Calibration of the logarithmic-periodic dipole antenna (LPDA) radio stations  at the Pierre Auger Observatory using an octocopter},
journal = {JINST},
abstract = {An in-situ calibration of a logarithmic periodic dipole   antenna with a frequency coverage of 30 MHz to 80 MHz is   performed. Such antennas are part of a radio station system used for   detection of cosmic ray induced air showers at the Engineering Radio   Array of the Pierre Auger Observatory, the so-called Auger   Engineering Radio Array (AERA) . The directional and frequency   characteristics of the broadband antenna are investigated using a   remotely piloted aircraft carrying a small transmitting antenna. The   antenna sensitivity is described by the vector effective length   relating the measured voltage with the electric-field components   perpendicular to the incoming signal direction. The horizontal and   meridional components are determined with an overall uncertainty of   7.4+0.9−0.3% and 10.3+2.8−1.7% respectively. The   measurement is used to correct a simulated response of the frequency   and directional response of the antenna.  In addition, the influence   of the ground conductivity and permittivity on the antenna response   is simulated. Both have a negligible influence given the ground   conditions measured at the detector site. The overall uncertainties   of the vector effective length components result in an uncertainty   of 8.8+2.1−1.3% in the square root of the energy fluence   for incoming signal directions with zenith angles smaller than   60°.}

abstract = {Measuring radio emission from air showers offers a novel way to determine properties of the primary cosmic rays such as their mass and energy. Theory predicts that relativistic time compression effects lead to a ring of amplified emission which starts to dominate the emission pattern for frequencies above ∼100MHz. In this article we present the first detailed measurements of this structure. Ring structures in the radio emission of air showers are measured with the LOFAR radio telescope in the frequency range of 110–190MHz. These data are well described by CoREAS simulations. They clearly confirm the importance of including the index of refraction of air as a function of height. Furthermore, the presence of the Cherenkov ring offers the possibility for a geometrical measurement of the depth of shower maximum, which in turn depends on the mass of the primary particle.}

	abstract = {Radio emission of the quiet Sun is considered to be due to thermal bremsstrahlung emission of the hot solar atmosphere. The properties of the quiet Sun in the microwave band have been well studied, and they can be well described by the spectrum of bremsstrahlung emission. In the meter-wave and decameter-wave bands, properties of the quiet Sun have rarely been studied due to the instrumental limitations. In this work, we use the LOw Frequency ARray telescope to perform high quality interferometric imaging spectroscopy observations of quiet Sun coronal emission at frequencies below 90 MHz. We present the brightness temperature spectrum and the size of the Sun in the frequency range of 20–80 MHz. We report on dark coronal regions with low brightness temperatures that persist with frequency. The brightness temperature spectrum of the quiet Sun is discussed and compared with the bremsstrahlung emission of a coronal model and previous quiet Sun observations.}

The main aim was to observe at a frequency high enough to avoid strong depolarization at intermediate Galactic latitudes (still present at 1.4 GHz) to study Galactic magnetism, but low enough to retain ample signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) at high latitudes for extragalactic and cosmological science. We developed a new scanning strategy based on long azimuth scans and a corresponding map-making procedure to make recovery of the overall mean signal of Stokes Q and U possible, a long-standing problem with polarization observations. We describe the scanning strategy, map-making procedure and validation tests. The overall mean signal is recovered with a precision better than 0.5 per cent. The maps have a mean sensitivity of 0.81 mK on beam-size scales and show clear polarized signals, typically to within a few degrees of the Galactic plane, with ample S/N everywhere (the typical signal in low-emission regions is 13 mK and 98.6 per cent of pixels have S/N \\&gt; 3). The largest depolarization areas are in the inner Galaxy, associated with the Sagittarius Arm. We have also computed a rotation measure map combining S-PASS with archival data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) and Planck experiments. A Stokes I map has been generated, with sensitivity limited to the confusion level of 9 mK.}",

The observing frequency has been chosen to provide a signal that is dominated by Galactic synchrotron emission, but suffers little from Faraday rotation, so that the measured polarization directions provide a good template for higher frequency observations, and carry direct information about the Galactic magnetic field. Telescopes in both northern and southern hemispheres with matched optical performance are used to provide all-sky coverage from a ground-based experiment. A continuous-comparison radiometer and a correlation polarimeter on each telescope provide stable imaging properties such that all angular scales from the instrument resolution of 45 arcmin up to full sky are accurately measured. The northern instrument has completed its survey and the southern instrument has started observing. We expect that C-BASS data will significantly improve the component separation analysis of Planck and other CMB data, and will provide important constraints on the properties of anomalous Galactic dust and the Galactic magnetic field.}",

abstract = {In the last fifteen years radio detection made it back to the list of promising techniques for extensive air showers, firstly, due to the installation and successful operation of digital radio experiments and, secondly, due to the quantitative understanding of the radio emission from atmospheric particle cascades. The radio technique has an energy threshold of about 100PeV, which coincides with the energy at which a transition from the highest-energy galactic sources to the even more energetic extragalactic cosmic rays is assumed. Thus, radio detectors are particularly useful to study the highest-energy galactic particles and ultra-high-energy extragalactic particles of all types. Recent measurements by various antenna arrays like LOPES, CODALEMA, AERA, LOFAR, Tunka-Rex, and others have shown that radio measurements can compete in precision with other established techniques, in particular for the arrival direction, the energy, and the position of the shower maximum, which is one of the best estimators for the composition of the primary cosmic rays. The scientific potential of the radio technique seems to be maximum in combination with particle detectors, because this combination of complementary detectors can significantly increase the total accuracy for air-shower measurements. This increase in accuracy is crucial for a better separation of different primary particles, like gamma-ray photons, neutrinos, or different types of nuclei, because showers initiated by these particles differ in average depth of the shower maximum and in the ratio between the amplitude of the radio signal and the number of muons. In addition to air-shower measurements, the radio technique can be used to measure particle cascades in dense media, which is a promising technique for detection of ultra-high-energy neutrinos. Several pioneering experiments like ARA, ARIANNA, and ANITA are currently searching for the radio emission by neutrino-induced particle cascades in ice. In the next years these two sub-fields of radio detection of cascades in air and in dense media will likely merge, because several future projects aim at the simultaneous detection of both, high-energy cosmic-rays and neutrinos. SKA will search for neutrino and cosmic-ray initiated cascades in the lunar regolith and simultaneously provide unprecedented detail for air-shower measurements. Moreover, detectors with huge exposure like GRAND, SWORD or EVA are being considered to study the highest energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. This review provides an introduction to the physics of radio emission by particle cascades, an overview on the various experiments and their instrumental properties, and a summary of methods for reconstructing the most important air-shower properties from radio measurements. Finally, potential applications of the radio technique in high-energy astroparticle physics are discussed.}

We present a total intensity map of the North Celestial Pole (NCP) region of sky, above declination \\&gt;+80°, which is limited by source confusion at a level of ≈0.6 mK rms. We apply the template-fitting (cross-correlation) technique to WMAP and Planck data, using the C-BASS map as the synchrotron template, to investigate the contribution of diffuse foreground emission at frequencies ∼20–40 GHz. We quantify the anomalous microwave emission (AME) that is correlated with far-infrared dust emission. The AME amplitude does not change significantly (\\$\\{\\lt \\}10\\, \\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$) when using the higher frequency C-BASS 4.7 GHz template instead of the traditional Haslam 408 MHz map as a tracer of synchrotron radiation. We measure template coefficients of 9.93 ± 0.35 and \\$9.52\\pm 0.34\\,\\$ K per unit τ353 when using the Haslam and C-BASS synchrotron templates, respectively. The AME contributes \\$55\\pm 2\\, \\mu\\$K rms at 22.8 GHz and accounts for \\$\\{\\approx \\} 60\\{\\{\\ \\rm per\\ cent\\}\\}\\$ of the total foreground emission. Our results show that a harder (flatter spectrum) component of synchrotron emission is not dominant at frequencies ≳5 GHz; the best-fitting synchrotron temperature spectral index is β = −2.91 ± 0.04 from 4.7 to 22.8 GHz and β = −2.85 ± 0.14 from 22.8 to 44.1 GHz.

Geometrically scaled aerials having beamwidths of 17° × 12° and 53° × 12° have been used, and the results are compared to deduce the spectrum of the background between these frequencies. The observed variation of the spectral index across the sky is fitted by a model in which the galactic contribution has temperature spectral indices 2.38 ± 0.03 and 2.46 ± 0.04 for two different regions of sky, superimposed upon an isotropic background due to radio galaxies, amounting to 30° ± 7°K at 178 MHz. The galactic contributions are considered to be associated with radiation from the local spiral arm and from the inter-arm region, respectively.The results are compared with those of other workers at 26.3, 38, 81.5, 178, and 404 MHz. In both regions, straight galactic spectra are found between 13.15 and 178 MHz, with temperature spectral indices 2.38 ± 0.02 and 2.45 ± 0.03. Both spectra steepen appreciably by 404 MHz, and it is concluded that the magnetic field strengths are very similar in the two regions. It is suggested that a change in the dominant production mechanism of cosmic ray electrons takes place at energies in the region of 3 GeV. The observed energy spectrum of primary cosmic ray electrons is shown to be consistent with that deduced from the new radio data.}",

  journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series},
  abstract = {The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) had a tremendous impact on many areas of modern astrophysics. In particular, it revealed the ubiquity of infrared cirrus that are a spectacular manifestation of the interstellar medium complexity but also an important foreground for observational cosmology. With the forthcoming Planck satellite there is a need for all-sky complementary data sets with arcminute resolution that can bring informations on specific foreground emissions that contaminate the cosmic microwave background radiation. With its ∼4′ resolution matching perfectly the high-frequency bands of Planck, IRAS is a natural data set to study the variations of dust properties at all scales. But the latest version of the images delivered by the IRAS team (the ISSA plates) suffer from calibration, zero level, and striping problems that can preclude its use, especially at 12 and 25 μm. In this paper we present how we proceeded to solve each of these problems and enhance significantly the general quality of the ISSA plates in the four bands (12, 25, 60, and 100 μm). This new generation of IRAS images, called IRIS, benefits from a better zodiacal light subtraction, from a calibration and zero level compatible with DIRBE, and from a better destriping. At 100 μm the IRIS product is also a significant improvement from the Schlegel et al. maps. IRIS keeps the full ISSA resolution, it includes well-calibrated point sources, and the diffuse emission calibration at scales smaller than 1° was corrected for the variation of the IRAS detector responsivity with scale and brightness. The uncertainty on the IRIS calibration and zero level is dominated by the uncertainty on the DIRBE calibration and on the accuracy of the zodiacal light model.}

These data provide crucial information on the investigation and characterisation of the properties of dusty material in the interstellar medium (ISM), since a significant portion of its energy is emitted between ∼ 50 and 200 μm. The large-scale distribution of interstellar clouds, their thermal dust temperatures, and their column densities can be investigated with the improved spatial resolution compared to earlier all-sky survey observations. In addition to the point source distribution, the large-scale distribution of ISM cirrus emission, and its filamentary structure, are well traced. We have made the first public release of the full-sky data to provide a legacy data set for use in the astronomical community.}",

The map includes a portion of the galactic plane, the high-latitude region of minimum sky brightness and part of the north galactic spur. Comparisons are made with surveys at higher radio frequencies and with optically observed H II regions of large angular size; most of these H II regions give rise to prominent absorption features on the map, and these are discussed in detail. A new estimate of the mean value of the emissivity of galactic non-thermal radiation has been derived and most of the emission is shown to be confined to the spiral arms, with much lower emission present in the interarm region.}",
