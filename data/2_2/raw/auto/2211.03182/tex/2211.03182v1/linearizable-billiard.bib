  abstract = {The classical Birkhoff conjecture claims that the boundary of a strictly convex integrable billiard table is necessarily an ellipse (or a circle as a special case). In this article we prove a complete local version of this conjecture: a small integrable perturbation of an ellipse must be an ellipse. This extends and completes the result in Avila-De Simoi-Kaloshin, where nearly circular domains were considered. One of the crucial ideas in the proof is to extend action-angle coordinates for elliptic billiards into complex domains (with respect to the angle), and to thoroughly analyze the nature of their complex singularities. As an application, we are able to prove some spectral rigidity results for elliptic domains.},

  abstract = {We consider a singular perturbation for a family of analytic symplectic maps of the annulus possessing a KAM torus. The perturbation introduces dissipation and contains an adjustable parameter. By choosing the adjustable parameter, one can ensure that the torus persists under perturbation. Such models are common in celestial mechanics. In field theory, the adjustable parameter is called the counterterm and in celestial mechanics, the drift. It is known that there are formal expansions in powers of the perturbation both for the quasi-periodic solution and the counterterm. We prove that the asymptotic expansions for the quasiperiodic solutions and the counterterm satisfy Gevrey estimates. That is, the nth term of the expansion is bounded by a power of n!. The Gevrey class (the power of n!) depends only on the Diophantine condition of the frequency and the order of the friction coefficient in powers of the perturbative parameter. The method of proof we introduce may be of interest beyond the problem considered here. We consider a modified Newton method in a space of power expansions. As is custumary in KAM theory, each step of the method is estimated in a smaller domain. In contrast with the KAM results, the domains where we control the Newton method shrink very fast and the Newton method does not prove that the solutions are analytic. On the other hand, by examining carefully the process, we can obtain estimates on the coefficients of the expansions and conclude the series are Gevrey.},

In the same paper there is also numerical evidence that for ``good'' rotation angles the series have positive radii of convergence. In the present paper we carry out a further study (both analytic and numerical) of the conjugacy equation.

  abstract = {In this paper we prove the Birkhoff-Poritsky conjecture for centrally-symmetric \$C\^2\$-smooth convex planar billiards. We assume that the domain \$\textbackslash mathcal\{A\}\$ between the invariant curve of \$4\$-periodic orbits and the boundary of the phase cylinder is foliated by \$C\^0\$-invariant curves. Under this assumption we prove that the billiard curve is an ellipse. For the original Birkhoff-Poritsky formulation we show that if a neighborhood of the boundary of billiard domain has a \$C\^1\$-smooth foliation by convex caustics of rotation numbers in the interval \$(0; 1/4]\$, then the boundary curve is an ellipse. In the language of first integrals one can assert that if the billiard inside a centrally-symmetric \$C\^2\$-smooth convex curve \$\textbackslash gamma\$ admits a \$C\^1\$-smooth first integral with non-vanishing gradient on \$\textbackslash mathcal\{A\}\$, then the curve \$\textbackslash gamma\$ is an ellipse. The main ingredients of the proof are (1) the non-standard generating function for convex billiards; (2) the remarkable structure of the invariant curve consisting of \$4\$-periodic orbits; and (3) the integral-geometry approach for rigidity results that was invented by the first named author for circular billiards. Surprisingly, we establish a Hopf-type rigidity for billiard in ellipse.},
