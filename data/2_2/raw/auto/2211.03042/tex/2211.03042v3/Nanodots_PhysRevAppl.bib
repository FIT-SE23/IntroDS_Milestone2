  abstract = {Magnetostatic field calculations in micromagnetic simulations can be numerically expensive, particularly in the case of large-scale finite element simulations. The established finite element/boundary element method (FEM/BEM) by Fredkin and Koehler (1990) involves a densely populated matrix with unacceptable numerical costs for problems with a large number of degrees of freedom N. By using hierarchical matrices of H2 type, we show that the memory requirements of this FEM/BEM method can be reduced dramatically, effectively converting the quadratic complexity O(N2) of the problem to a linear one O(N). We obtain matrix size reductions of nearly 99% in test cases with more than 106 degrees of freedom, and we test the computed magnetostatic energy values by means of comparison with analytic values. The efficiency of the H2-matrix compression opens the way to large-scale magnetostatic field calculations in micromagnetic modeling, all while preserving the accuracy of the established FEM/BEM formalism.},

  abstract       = {Ferromagnetic resonance is a powerful method for the study of all classes of magnetic materials. The experimental technique has been used for many decades and is based on the excitation of a magnetic spin system via a microwave (or rf) field. While earlier methods were based on the use of a microwave spectrometer, more recent developments have seen the widespread use of the vector network analyzer (VNA), which provides a more versatile measurement system at almost comparable sensitivity. While the former is based on a fixed frequency of excitation, the VNA enables frequency-dependent measurements, allowing more in-depth analysis. We have applied this technique to the study of nanostructured thin films or nanodots and coupled magnetic layer systems comprised of exchange-coupled ferromagnetic layers with in-plane and perpendicular magnetic anisotropies. In the first system, we have investigated the magnetization dynamics in Co/Ag bilayers and nanodots. In the second system, we have studied Permalloy (Ni80Fe20, hereafter Py) thin films coupled via an intervening Al layer of varying thickness to a NdCo film which has perpendicular magnetic anisotropy.},

While the magnetization reversal modes of sub-100 nm Fe nanodots has been reported, currently there is a lack of information about the temperature evolution of the magnetic properties of larger Fe nanodots. In this work, the magnetism of Fe/Ag thin films and nanodot arrays were comparatively analyzed over the temperature range of 2–300 K. A natively-oxidized α-Fe2O3 layer was formed at the Fe/SiO2 interface, and this oxide resulted in an exchange bias at low temperatures. The in-plane and out-of-plane magnetization reversal modes of nanodot arrays were revealed through the magnetic hysteresis loops’ temperature dependence. The contribution of exchange coupling between Fe and α-Fe2O3 was also identified through the temperature dependence of the coercivity, exchange bias, and DC susceptibility. Our results provide new insights towards understanding the magnetization dynamics in nanosized magnetic elements.},

Experimental observations of this resonance are reported, the underlying physical conditions are explained and a general “exchange boundary condition” is formulated and derived. A description is given of an experimental method for measuring both components of the complex equivalent permeability. Static measurements as well as resonance curves at 3000 and 4000 Mc/s are presented for monocrystalline and polycrystalline samples of a nickel-iron alloy having extremely low magnetocrystalline anisotropy. At room temperature the complete experimental resonance curves can be interpreted on the basis of the theory of Ament and Rado by using an effective exchange stiffness constant, A, of (3.3±0.5) × 10−6 erg/cm and a spectroscopic splitting factor, g, of 2.06±0.01. The agreement between theory and experiment would be destroyed if a Landau-Lifshitz or Bloch damping term were included. Possible processes influencing the value of A are discussed. Experimental data taken at liquid-nitrogen temperature show an increase in the resonance line width and a decrease in the resonance field. Both effects are in qualitative but not quantitative agreement with the theory. A part of the discrepancy can be attributed to anomalous effects caused by the electronic mean free path.},

However{,} intrinsic properties of nanomagnets are often poorly known and can hardly be assessed by local optical probe techniques. Here{,} an original spatially resolved approach is demonstrated for spin-wave spectroscopy of individual circular magnetic elements with sample volumes down to about 10−3 μm3. The key component of the setup is a coplanar waveguide whose microsized central part is placed over a movable substrate with well-separated CoFe-FEBID nanodisks which exhibit standing spin-wave resonances. The circular symmetry of the disks allows for the deduction of the saturation magnetization and the exchange stiffness of the material using an analytical theory. A good correspondence between the results of analytical calculations and micromagnetic simulations is revealed{,} indicating a validity of the used analytical model going beyond the initial thin-disk approximation used in the theoretical derivation. The presented approach is especially valuable for the characterization of direct-write magnetic elements opening new horizons for 3D nanomagnetism and magnonics.},

We discuss the application of the theory to various systems, with a description of amorphous and nanocrystalline materials which have not received much attention with respect to FMR and SWR. In this respect, we treat these materials in a multiphase manner for the first time, where previous FMR measurements on these types of material have been analysed and interpreted as single phase ferromagnets. Although the general theory is applicable to an N phase material, we show the detailed analysis for two phase systems, giving examples of both magnetic multilayers and mixed double phase ferromagnets of the type for mixed nanocrystalline and amorphous magnetic systems. The theory would also be applicable to systems where a magnetic phase is surrounded by a non-magnetic phase, such as co-deposited systems. We also consider, for the first time, the possibility of the existence of standing spin wave modes in mixed phase and granular materials. The adaptability of the general theory to any form of magnetocrystalline anisotropy and interphase interaction is also discussed.},

  abstract  = {Understanding the role of the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction (DMI) for the formation of helimagnetic order, as well as the emergence of skyrmions in magnetic systems that lack inversion symmetry, has found increasing interest due to the significant potential for novel spin based technologies. Candidate materials to host skyrmions include those belonging to the B20 group such as FeGe, known for stabilising Bloch-like skyrmions, interfacial systems such as cobalt multilayers or Pd/Fe bilayers on top of Ir(111), known for stabilising Néel-like skyrmions, and, recently, alloys with a crystallographic symmetry where anti-skyrmions are stabilised. Micromagnetic simulations have become a standard approach to aid the design and optimisation of spintronic and magnetic nanodevices and are also applied to the modelling of device applications which make use of skyrmions. Several public domain micromagnetic simulation packages such as OOMMF, MuMax3 and Fidimag already offer implementations of different DMI terms. It is therefore highly desirable to propose a so-called micromagnetic standard problem that would allow one to benchmark and test the different software packages in a similar way as is done for ferromagnetic materials without the DMI. Here, we provide a sequence of well-defined and increasingly complex computational problems for magnetic materials with DMI. Our test problems include 1D, 2D and 3D domains, spin wave dynamics in the presence of DMI, and validation of the analytical and numerical solutions including uniform magnetisation, edge tilting, spin waves and skyrmion formation. This set of problems can be used by developers and users of new micromagnetic simulation codes for testing and validation and hence establishing scientific credibility.},

The theoretical treatment, starting from the general model assumptions made when dealing with thin magnetic films, concentrates specifically on the Surface Inhomogeneity Model, for which a Hamiltonian is established and diagonalized, leading to the elementary magnetic excitation i.e. spin waves of the system. The appropriate spin wave resonance theory is developed in detail, and the resonance effects are expounded on the basis of a Pinning Diagram, especially constructed for this purpose. Particular attention is given to the existence conditions for surface states, the experimental identification of their respective resonance lines, as well as the use of these lines when determining the surface conditions of the thin film and measuring its magnetic surface anisotropy. The analysis of the surface state properties is based on the exact solution of the eigenvalue problem of a finite linear chain with arbitrary (asymmetric) boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {In this paper we provide a concise review of present achievements in the study of spin-wave resonance (SWR) in ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As thin films. The theoretical treatment of the experimental SWR data obtained so far concentrates specifically on the spherical surface pinning (SSP) model, in which the surface spin pinning energy is expressed by configuration angles (the out-of-plane polar angle ϑ and the in-plane azimuthal angle φ) defining the direction of surface magnetization in the considered thin film. The model is based on a series expansion of the surface spin pinning energy; the terms in the series represent the respective pinning contributions from the cubic anisotropy as well as uniaxial anisotropies. Comparing theory with the reported experimental studies of SWR in thin films of the ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As, we find that besides the first-order cubic anisotropy, higher-order cubic anisotropies (in the second and third orders) as well as uniaxial anisotropies (perpendicular in the first and second orders, and in-plane diagonal) occur on the surface of this material. We use our results to plot a 3D hypersurface visualizing the angle dependence of the surface spin pinning energy in configurational space. An advantage of this spatial representation is that the shape of the obtained hypersurface allows us to predict new SWR effects that have not yet been observed experimentally. Prospective experimental studies for the verification of this surface pinning model would bring new insight into the surface anisotropy phenomenon in (Ga,Mn)As thin films and help complete the knowledge in this field, the shortage of which in the literature available to date is becoming bothersome.},

The  temperature dependence of the magnetization, of the magnetic relaxation rate in the vicinity of the Curie temperature, and of the second- and fourth-order magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) constants can be measured by FMR  in situ for magnetic monolayers. Using the cases of Ni/Cu(001) and Gd/W(110) as examples, the role of the MAE for the quantitative description of temperature- and thickness-dependent reorientation transitions of the magnetization is discussed. Initial results for the anisotropy of the g-factor which is related to the anisotropy of the orbital moment (and the MAE) are presented.},

The overview of materials used for magnetic sensors comprises semiconductor materials and the soft and hard magnetic materials in thin film, bulk and tape form in detail. We discuss the properties and effects most critical for the decisive parameters of magnetic sensors, for example remanence, crossfield sensitivity and temperature stability of the offset. By far, most of the produced magnetic sensors are devices based on the Hall effect. These semiconductor sensors are cheap and can be made small, but their resolution and stability is rather limited. The fast development of ferromagnetic magnetoresistors (AMR, GMR, and SDT) for magnetic reading heads also brought these devices into the sensor scope. In the chapter devoted to fluxgate sensors, we concentrate on miniaturization of these traditional devices and compare them to GMI sensors. We describe the status of resonant sensors, induction coils and SQUIDs, and briefly mention other more exotic methods of magnetic field measurements. An overview of magnetic sensors for mechanical quantities, such as position and force, is also given with special focus on torque sensors. One section is devoted to the sensing of electric current based on magnetic principles. In conclusion, various applications of magnetic sensors are listed and discussed.},

We investigate prototype Cu/Ni/Cu/Ni/Cu(001) and Ni/Cu/Co/Cu(001) trilayers as well as Fen/Vm superlattices. We show for the case of trilayers how in situ ultrahigh vacuum FMR can be used to determine Jinter in absolute energy units in a straightforward way: we first prepare and measure the bottom magnetic layer together with the Cu spacer in situ and then evaporate the second magnetic film on top. Thus, it is possible to investigate the FMR signal before and after the two magnetic films become coupled. We discuss results, showing that the temperature dependence of Jinter follows a T3/2 law over a wide temperature range. This indicates that thermally excited spin waves at the interface of the ferromagnetic layers dominate the temperature dependence of Jinter. The second part focuses on the measurement of the g value. From the g value, the ratio of orbital to spin magnetic moment can be obtained via the relation μL /μS  =  (g − 2)/2. We show for Fen/Vm superlattices how μL /μS increases with decreasing Fe-layer thickness.},

TCFC is a ferromagnet having high Curie temperature and provides controllable induced magnetic anisotropy. Experimental studies showed that the interlayer interaction of the TCFC/LSMO heterostructure is antiferromagnetic. There was an increase in the FMR line width in the structures due to the flow of a spin current through the interface between two films. There was electric voltage in the TCFC/YIG heterostructure induced in the TCFC intermetallide film, due to an inverse spin Hall effect under ferromagnetic resonance conditions.},

  abstract  = {Magnetic nanoparticle assemblies present novel magnetic properties with respect to their bulk constituent components. In addition to the surface effects produced by the modified atomic symmetry in such low dimensional systems, the magnetic coupling between the particles also plays a significant role in determining the overall magnetic behavior of a magnetic nanoparticle assembly. In this Chapter, we describe a theoretical model that accounts for the dipolar magnetic interaction between particles. There are two fundamental aspects of interest in our studies: the spatial distribution of the particles and density of the particle. These aspects have been addressed in our simulations, where we have performed simulations for regular and random arrays of particles. We will discuss the general theory of ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) applied to such systems and how the specific dipolar interactions can be incorporated for nanoparticle systems. The spatial distribution of particles can give valuable information of the strength of the dipolar interaction between them and we will demonstrate how this can be used in real systems. We have performed FMR experiments on nanoparticle assemblies of $\gamma$ -- Fe2O3 nanoparticles with different average particle sizes (2.7--7.3 nm) and particle densities, where samples are in rectangular slab shape. Measurements were performed as a function of the angle between the sample plane and applied magnetic field. Recent studies have shown that the incorporation of the dipolar interactions into FMR theory can explain the experimental results for angular studies in magnetic nanoparticle assemblies [1].},
