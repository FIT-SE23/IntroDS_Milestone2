\section{Limitation}

\label{sec:limitation}
One limitation of the MiddleGAN is, in fact, similar to the limitation with most GANs: the MiddleGAN, just like the other GANs, require a substantial amount of data to generate samples. Since the MiddleGAN generates samples based on both the source domain and the target domain, it is required that both the source and target domains have many samples. In each of the 24 domain adaptation tasks that we evaluate above, there are many samples both in the source and target domains, which is why the MiddleGAN is able to generate images that are similar to both the source and target samples. A future work is to investigate how the decreasing of the numbers of the source and target samples affect the MiddleGAN's performance. \hnote{This might backfire, as we can already study how the number of instances in each domain would affect the model's performance. Since we are already in the unsupervised domain adaptation regime, I guess size of dataset should not be a concern? The real concern to me is how the pseudo labels in the target domain affect the model's performance.}
