In this system, a relation similar to the van der Waals equation is obtained between the width of the box and the pressure working on the sidewalls. The autocorrelation function of each particle’s position is calculated numerically. This calculation shows that, near the critical width, the time at which the correlation becomes zero gets longer as the height of the box increases. Moreover, fast and slow relaxation processes such as the α and β relaxations in supercooled liquids are observed when the height of the box is sufficiently large. These relaxation processes are discussed with reference to the probability distribution of the relative positions of the two particles. © 2001 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {Granular materials consist of macroscopic grains, interacting via contact forces, and unaffected by thermal fluctuations. They are one of a class systems that undergo jamming, i.e. a transition between fluid-like and disordered solid-like states. Roughly twenty years ago, proposals by Cates et al for the shear response of colloidal systems and by Liu and Nagel, for a universal jamming diagram in a parameter space of packing fraction, φ, shear stress, τ, and temperature, T raised key questions. Contemporaneously, experiments by Howell et al and numerical simulations by Radjai et al and by Luding et al helped provide a starting point to explore key insights into jamming for dry, cohesionless, granular materials. A recent experimental observation by Bi et al is that frictional granular materials have a a re-entrant region in their jamming diagram. In a range of φ, applying shear strain, γ, from an initially force/stress free state leads to fragile (in the sense of Cates et al), then anisotropic shear jammed states. Shear jamming at fixed φ is presumably conjugate to Reynolds dilatancy, involving dilation under shear against deformable boundaries. Numerical studies by Radjai and Roux showed that Reynolds dilatancy does not occur for frictionless systems. Recent numerical studies by several groups show that shear jamming occurs for finite, but not infinite, systems of frictionless grains. Shear jamming does not lead to known ordering in position space, but Sarkar et al showed that ordering occurs in a space of force tiles. Experimental studies seeking to understand random loose and random close packings (rlp and rcp) and dating back to Bernal have probed granular packings and their response to shear and intruder motion. These studies suggest that rlp's are anisotropic and shear-jammed-like, whereas rcp's are likely isotropically jammed states. Jammed states are inherently static, but the jamming diagram may provide a context for understanding rheology, i.e. dynamic shear in a variety of systems that include granular materials and suspensions.},

Using simulations of shear reversal tests, we study the relationship between plastic work and irreversible rearrangements of the contact network. Infinitesimal strains are reversible, while any finite strain generates plastic work and contact changes in a sufficiently large packing. The number of irreversible contact changes grows with strain, and the stress–strain curve displays a crossover from linear to increasingly nonlinear response when the fraction of irreversible contact changes approaches unity.},

@article{Boschan,
   abstract = {The shear response of soft solids can be modeled with linear elasticity, provided the forcing is slow and weak. Both of these approximations must break down when the material loses rigidity, such as in foams and emulsions at their (un)jamming point-suggesting that the window of linear elastic response near jamming is exceedingly narrow. Yet precisely when and how this breakdown occurs remains unclear. To answer these questions, we perform computer simulations of stress relaxation and shear start-up tests in athermal soft sphere packings, the canonical model for jamming. By systematically varying the strain amplitude, strain rate, distance to jamming, and system size, we identify characteristic strain and time scales that quantify how and when the window of linear elasticity closes, and relate these scales to changes in the microscopic contact network.},

   abstract = {We show that the yielding transition in granular media displays second-order critical-point scaling behavior. We carry out discrete element simulations in the low-inertial-number limit for frictionless, purely repulsive spherical grains undergoing simple shear at fixed nondimensional shear stress Σ in two and three spatial dimensions. To find a mechanically stable (MS) packing that can support the applied Σ, isotropically prepared states with size L must undergo a total strain γms(Σ,L). The number density of MS packings (∝γms-1) vanishes for Σ>Σc≈0.11 according to a critical scaling form with a length scale ξ∝|Σ-Σc|-ν, where ν≈1.7-1.8. Above the yield stress (Σ>Σc), no MS packings that can support Σ exist in the large-system limit L/ξ≫1. MS packings generated via shear possess anisotropic force and contact networks, suggesting that Σc is associated with an upper limit in the degree to which these networks can be deformed away from those for isotropic packings.},

We quantify experimentally the constitutive relations for strain amplitudes as low as 10-3 and for a range of packing fractions within 2% variation around the jamming transition. At the transition strong nonlinear effects set in: both the shear modulus and the dilatancy shear soften at small strain until a critical strain is reached where effective linearity is recovered. The scaling of the critical strain and the associated critical stresses on the distance to jamming are extracted. We check that the constitutive laws, together with mechanical equilibrium, correctly predict to the observed stress and strain profiles. These profiles exhibit a spatial crossover between an effective linear regime close to the inflater and the truly nonlinear regime away from it.

Often used as structural materials for their attractive mechanical properties, their utility depends critically on their response to applied stresses. Processes underlying such mechanical response, and in particular the yielding behaviour of amorphous solids, are not satisfactorily understood. Although studied extensively, observed yielding behaviour can be gradual and depend significantly on conditions of study, making it difficult to convincingly validate existing theoretical descriptions of a sharp yielding transition. Here we employ oscillatory deformation as a reliable probe of the yielding transition. Through extensive computer simulations for a wide range of system sizes, we demonstrate that cyclically deformed model glasses exhibit a sharply defined yielding transition with characteristics that are independent of preparation history. In contrast to prevailing expectations, the statistics of avalanches reveals no signature of the impending transition, but exhibit dramatic, qualitative, changes in character across the transition.},

@article{Lennard38,
   abstract = {<p> The object of the first paper on “Critical Phenomena in Gases” (referred to in this paper as Paper I) was to develop a simple method of dealing with dense gases and to calculate critical temperatures in terms of atomic fields of force. Each atom in a dense gas was pictured as caged for most of its time by a cluster of neighbours, equal in number to those which surround it in the solid (and presumably also in the liquid) phase. The model was intended to provide a general average of the potential field in which any one atom moved by replacing its varying environment by an arrangement of neighbours which could be regarded as typical. This arrangement was taken to be the one in which the neighbours were situated at their mean positions as determined by the density of the gas. The potential energy of any one atom could thus be expressed as a function of the volume of the gas—a step which is probably the crucial one in a theory of critical phenomena. This point of view brings the process of condensation within the category of those described by Fowler (1936) as <italic>co-operative</italic> phenomena. In passing we may observe that the derivation of van der Waals’ equation provides a particular example of this method, for in it the potential energy of each atom is assumed to be inversely proportional to the volume. The present theory goes beyond this simple model, for the potential energy of an atom is considered to be not only a function of volume but also a function of the position of the atom relative to its neighbours. The probability of finding an atom in any assigned position can be calculated by statistical means and its average potential energy and its available free volume easily deduced. The equation of state can then be deduced by thermodynamic methods, as has been pointed out elsewhere (Lennard-Jones 1937). </p>},

Here we review the current understanding of the transition to jamming and the nature of the jammed state for disordered packings of particles that act through repulsive contact interactions and are at zero temperature and zero shear stress. We first discuss the breakdown of affine assumptions that underlies the rich mechanics near jamming. We then extensively discuss jamming of frictionless soft spheres. At the jamming point, these systems are marginally stable (isostatic) in the sense of constraint counting, and many geometric and mechanical properties scale with distance to this jamming point. Finally, we discuss current explorations of jamming of frictional and non-spherical (ellipsoidal) particles. Both friction and asphericity tune the contact number at jamming away from the isostatic limit, but in opposite directions. This allows one to disentangle the distance to jamming and the distance to isostaticity. The picture that emerges is that most quantities are governed by the contact number and scale with the distance to isostaticity, while the contact number itself scales with the distance to jamming. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

   abstract = {We poorly understand the properties of amorphous systems at small length scales, where a continuous elastic description breaks down. This is apparent when one considers their vibrational and transport properties, or the way forces propagate in these solids. Little is known about the microscopic cause of their rigidity. Recently it has been observed numerically that an assembly of elastic particles has a critical behavior near the jamming threshold where the pressure vanishes. At the transition such a system does not behave as a continuous medium at any length scales. When this system is compressed, scaling is observed for the elastic moduli, the coordination number, but also for the density of vibrational modes. In the present work, we derive theoretically these results, and show that they apply to various systems such as granular matter and silica, but also to colloidal glasses. In particular we show that: (i) these systems present a large excess of vibrational modes at low frequency in comparison with normal solids, called the "boson peak" in the glass literature. The corresponding modes are very different from plane waves, and their frequency is related to the system coordination; (ii) rigidity is a non-local property of the packing geometry, characterized by a length scale which can be large. For elastic particles this length diverges near the jamming transition; (iii) for repulsive systems the shear modulus can be much smaller than the bulk modulus. We compute the corresponding scaling laws near the jamming threshold. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results for the glass transition, the transport, and the geometry of the random close packing. © EDP Sciences.},

   abstract = {A detailed report is given of the fundamental aspects of the coherent potential theory which serves as the best single-site approximation to the ensemble-averaged one-particle Green's function 〈G〉 for restricted model Hamiltonian of elementary excitations in certain random lattices. The concept of the approximation is illustrated in a unified framework of the general perturbation method. Applications of the theory to various model systems and realistic problems of practical interest are reviewed and a wide range of physical properties in these systems are discussed. Particular attention is paid to the advantageous feature of the approach, and the successful results obtained in the applications are described in comparison with the conclusions due to the previous methods. Limitations of the theory are stated with emphasis on the problems which are left open and several recent attempts to extend the applicability of the method are also mentioned.},

@article{Maloney2006,
   abstract = {We present results on a series of two-dimensional atomistic computer simulations of amorphous systems subjected to simple shear in the athermal, quasistatic limit. The athermal quasistatic trajectories are shown to separate into smooth, reversible elastic branches which are intermittently broken by discrete catastrophic plastic events. The onset of a typical plastic event is studied with precision, and it is shown that the mode of the system which is responsible for the loss of stability has structure in real space which is consistent with a quadrupolar source acting on an elastic matrix. The plastic events themselves are shown to be composed of localized shear transformations which organize into lines of slip which span the length of the simulation cell, and a mechanism for the organization is discussed. Although within a single event there are strong spatial correlations in the deformation, we find little correlation from one event to the next, and these transient lines of slip are not to be confounded with the persistent regions of localized shear-so-called "shear bands"-found in related studies. The slip lines give rise to particular scalings with system length of various measures of event size. Strikingly, data obtained using three differing interaction potentials can be brought into quantitative agreement after a simple rescaling, emphasizing the insensitivity of the emergent plastic behavior in these disordered systems to the precise details of the underlying interactions. The results should be relevant to understanding plastic deformation in systems such as metallic glasses well below their glass temperature, soft glassy systems (such as dense emulsions), or compressed granular materials. © 2006 The American Physical Society.},
