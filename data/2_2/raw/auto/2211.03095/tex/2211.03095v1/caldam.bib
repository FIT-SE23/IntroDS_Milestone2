abstract = {A subset T⊆V(G) of vertices of a graph G is said to be cyclable if G has a cycle C containing every vertex of T, and for a positive integer k, a graph G is k-cyclable if every set of vertices of size at most k is cyclable. The TERMINAL CYCLABILITY problem asks, given a graph G and a set T of vertices, whether T is cyclable, and the k-CYCLABILITY problem asks, given a graph G and a positive integer k, whether G is k-cyclable. These problems are generalizations of the classical HAMILTONIAN CYCLE problem. We initiate the study of these problems for graph classes that admit polynomial algorithms for HAMILTONIAN CYCLE. We show that TERMINAL CYCLABILITY can be solved in linear time for interval graphs, bipartite permutation graphs and cographs. Moreover, we construct certifying algorithms that either produce a solution, that is a cycle, or output a graph separator that certifies a no-answer. We use these results to show that k-CYCLABILITY can be solved in polynomial time when restricted to the aforementioned graph classes.},

@article{Kawarabayashi2008,
abstract = {We consider the following problem: Given k independent edges in G. Is there a polynomial time algorithm to decide whether or not G has a cycle through all of these edges ? If the answer is yes, detect such a cycle in polynomial time. This problem can be viewed as an algorithmic aspect of the conjecture of Lov{\'{a}}sz [22] and Woodall [34]. For fixed k, it follows from the seminal result of Robertson and Seymour [29] that there is a polynomial time algorithm to decide this problem. But, the proof of its correctness requires the full power of machinery from the graph minor series of papers, which consist of more than 20 papers and >500 pages. In addition, the hidden constant is an extremely rapidly growing function of k. Even k∈=∈3, the algorithm is not practical at all. Our main result is to give a better algorithm for the problem in the following sense. 1 Even when k is a non-trivially super-constant number (up to O((loglogn)1/10)), there is a polynomial time algorithm for the above problem (So the hidden constant is not too large). 1 The time complexity is O(n 2), which improves Robertson and Seymour's algorithm whose time complexity is O(n 3). Our algorithm has several appealing features. Although our approach makes use of several ideas underlying the Robertson and Seymour's algorithm, our new algorithmic components allow us to give a self-contained proof within 10 pages, which is much shorter and simpler than Robertson and Seymour's. In addition, if an input is a planar graph or a bounded genus graph, we can get a better bound for the hidden constant. More precisely, for the planar case, when k is a non-trivially super-constant number up to O((logn/(loglogn))1/4), there is a polynomial time algorithm, and for the bounded genus case, when k is a non-trivially super-constant number up to k≥O((log(n/g)/(loglog(n/g)))1/4), there is a polynomial time algorithm, where g is the Euler genus. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {A unified approach to a variety of graph-theoretic problems is introduced. The k-closure Ck(G) of a simple graph G of order n is the graph obtained from G by recursively joining pairs of nonadjacent vertices with degree-sum at least k. It is shown that, for many properties P, one can find a suitable value of k (depending on P and n) such that if Ck(G) has P, then so does G. For instance, if P is the hamiltonian property, one may take k = n. Thus if Cn(G) is hamiltonian, then so is G; in particular, if n ≥ 3 and Cn(G) is complete, then G is hamiltonian. This condition for a graph to be hamiltonian is shown to imply the well-known conditions of Chv{\'{a}}tal and Las Vergnas. The same method, applied to other properties, yields many new theorems of a similar nature. {\textcopyright} 1976.},
