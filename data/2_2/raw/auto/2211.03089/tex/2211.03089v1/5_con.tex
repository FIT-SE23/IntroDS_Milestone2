In this work, we proposed \imwav{}, a method for open-domain image-to-audio generation. We empirically demonstrated that \imwav{} is superior to the evaluated baselines considering both fidelity and relevance metrics. In addition, we proposed \imhear{}, an out-of-domain benchmark for future evaluation of image-to-audio models. We hope that with the provided benchmark, comparing image-to-audio generation models will be standardized and more accessible. For future work, we would like to explore the effect of using multi-modal features for audio generation. Furthermore, we would like to evaluate \imwav{} considering complex multi-scene and multi-object image sequences.
