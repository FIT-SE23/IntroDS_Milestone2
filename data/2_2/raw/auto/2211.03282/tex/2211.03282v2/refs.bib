abstract = {The clinical and societal measurement of human sleep has increased exponentially in recent years. However, unlike other fields of medical analysis that have become highly automated, basic and clinical sleep research still relies on human visual scoring. Such human-based evaluations are time-consuming, tedious, and can be prone to subjective bias. Here, we describe a novel algorithm trained and validated on +30,000 hr of polysomnographic sleep recordings across heterogeneous populations around the world. This tool offers high sleep-staging accuracy that matches human scoring accuracy and interscorer agreement no matter the population kind. The software is designed to be especially easy to use, computationally low-demanding, open source, and free. Our hope is that this software facilitates the broad adoption of an industry-standard automated sleep staging software package.},

In this paper, we describe a scalable end-to-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.},

Sleep disorders affect the quality of life, and the clinical diagnosis of sleep disorders is a time-consuming and tedious process requiring recording and annotating polysomnographic records. In this work, we developed an auto-annotation algorithm based on polysomnographic records and a deep learning architecture that predicts sleep stages at the millisecond level. The model improves the efficiency of the polysomnographic record annotation process by automatically annotating each record within 3.8 s of computation time and with high accuracy. Disease-related sleep stages, such as arousal and apnea, can also be identified by this model, which further expands the physiological insights that the model can potentially provide. Finally, we explored the applicability of the model to data collected from a different modality to demonstrate the robustness of the model.}

 TITLE={Sleep: An Open-Source Python Software for Visualization, Analysis, and Staging of Sleep Data},
 JOURNAL={Frontiers in Neuroinformatics},
 VOLUME={11},

 DOI={10.3389/fninf.2017.00060},
 ISSN={1662-5196},
 ABSTRACT={We introduce Sleep, a new Python open-source graphical user interface (GUI) dedicated to visualization, scoring and analyses of sleep data. Among its most prominent features are: 1) Dynamic display of polysomnographic data, spectrogram, hypnogram and topographic maps with several customizable parameters, 2) Implementation of several automatic detection of sleep features such as spindles, K-complexes, slow waves and rapid eye movements, 3) Implementation of practical signal processing tools such as re-referencing or filtering, and 4) Display of main descriptive statistics including publication-ready tables and figures.  The software package supports loading and reading raw EEG data from a standard file formats such as European Data Format, in addition to a range of commercial data formats. Most importantly, Sleep is built on top of the VisPy library, which provides GPU-based fast and high-level visualization. As a result, it is capable of efficiently handling and displaying large sleep datasets. Sleep is freely available (http://visbrain.org/sleep) and comes with sample datasets and an extensive documentation. Novel functionalities will continue to be added and open-science community efforts are expected to enhance the capacities of this module.}
